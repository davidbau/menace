# A Traveler's Guide to the Mazes of Menace

> *"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a lone adventurer,
> in possession of a good weapon, must be in want of a spoiler file."*

## Before You Read Further

You are holding (or more likely scrolling through) a guide to the
Mazes of Menace, the vast and ever-shifting dungeon complex that sits
beneath a place the locals just call "the dungeon entrance." What lies
below is one of the oldest and most treacherous adventure destinations
in existence: dozens of levels of corridors, vaults, and special
chambers, stretching from the relatively tame upper mines all the way
down to the molten depths of Gehennom and beyond.

People have been descending into these depths for decades. Most of them
died. The ones who made it back brought stories, and some of those
stories eventually got written down. You're reading the latest edition
of that accumulated lore.

**A word of caution.** This guide will change how you experience the
Mazes forever. Once you know that a floating eye can paralyze you with
a glance, you can never un-know it. Once you learn what a cockatrice
corpse can do when wielded with gloves, the dungeon becomes a
different place. Some adventurers prefer the thrill of discovery over
the comfort of preparation. If that's you, close this guide now and
go learn things the hard way. There is real joy in that.

But if you've died to one too many rubber-banded acid blobs, or you're
tired of starving on dungeon level four because you didn't know you
could pray — read on. We'll do our best to keep you alive.

## Part One: Before You Set Out

### Choosing Your Expedition

The first decision you'll make, before you even set foot on the
stairs, is who you are. In the Mazes, this means three things: your
**role**, your **race**, and your **alignment**. Together, these
determine your starting equipment, your natural abilities, which gods
hear your prayers, and which artifacts you can safely handle.

Don't agonize over this choice too much on your first few trips. You
will die regardless, and each death teaches something. But if you'd
like a recommendation for a first expedition, read on.

#### The Roles

There are thirteen roles available to adventurers. Each comes with
different starting equipment, different intrinsic abilities gained at
various experience levels, and a different quest to complete in the
mid-game.

**Archeologist.** You start with a bullwhip, a pickaxe, and a tinning
kit. The pickaxe is quietly one of the best starting items in the
game: it lets you dig through walls and create your own escape routes from
the very first level. The tinning kit lets you preserve corpses for
later. Archeologists are capable and flexible, though a bit fragile in
early combat. You begin knowing what all gems are, which is a nice
parlor trick and occasionally useful for unicorn negotiation.
*Alignment: Lawful or Neutral.*

**Barbarian.** You start strong. Literally. A two-handed sword and
good starting strength mean you can hack through early monsters with
ease. The downside is that two-handed weapons prevent you from using a
shield, and Barbarians are not known for their finesse. You do get
poison resistance from the start, which saves you from several common
early deaths. A straightforward role for players who like straightforward
solutions. *Alignment: Neutral or Chaotic.*

**Cave Dweller.** You start primitive but tough, with a club and
some rocks for throwing. You gain speed early and your hit dice are
generous. The Cave Dweller's simplicity is a virtue: fewer tools
means fewer things to manage. *Alignment: Lawful or Neutral.*

**Healer.** You begin with a stethoscope, healing potions, and poison
resistance. The stethoscope is remarkable: it lets you check a
monster's hit points and your own internal state. Healers are fragile
fighters, but their medical knowledge keeps them alive through
situations that would kill other roles. You can also see whether
potions of sickness are safe, which streamlines identification
considerably. *Alignment: Neutral.*

**Knight.** You start mounted on a pony, which is both a blessing
and a liability. The pony is a decent combatant early on but will get
you into trouble if it wanders into a shop. Knights follow a code of
conduct that penalizes attacking fleeing or peaceful monsters. You get
a lance for jousting from horseback, which is very effective when it
works. *Alignment: Lawful.*

**Monk.** You fight best with bare hands and start with no weapon at
all, which is the point. Monks gain martial arts abilities as they
level, eventually becoming formidable unarmed combatants. You start
with sleep resistance and see invisible, and you should avoid eating
meat if you want to maintain your spiritual discipline. One of the
more unusual roles, rewarding for experienced players.
*Alignment: Any.*

**Priest.** You start with holy (or unholy) water and the ability to
intuitively sense whether items are blessed, cursed, or uncursed. This
is enormously useful. You know immediately whether that cloak you just
found is safe to wear. Priests are competent fighters with access to
clerical spells and begin with a mace. *Alignment: Any (matches your
god).*

**Ranger.** You start with a bow and a generous supply of arrows,
making you one of the strongest ranged combatants early on. Rangers
get stealth and see invisible early. Your elven racial option gives
you sleep resistance on top of that. If you enjoy picking off enemies
from a distance, this is your role. *Alignment: Neutral or Chaotic.*

**Rogue.** You start with a short sword, daggers for throwing, and a
sack. You get stealth from the beginning and your backstab ability
deals extra damage when you attack from hiding. Rogues are excellent
at avoiding trouble, which is often better than being good at
surviving it. *Alignment: Chaotic.*

**Samurai.** You start with a katana, which is one of the better
one-handed weapons in the game, plus a wakizashi backup and a yumi
bow with arrows. Samurai get speed early and have a strong martial
kit overall. The katana's damage output carries you through the
early game with ease. *Alignment: Lawful.*

**Tourist.** You start with a Hawaiian shirt, a credit card, a camera,
and a truly absurd number of darts. Tourists are deliberately designed
to be the hardest role in the game. Your starting equipment is mostly
a joke, your combat abilities are poor, and the dungeon seems to know
it. That said, the darts are actually useful for training ranged
skills, and the camera can blind monsters in a pinch. A role for
people who have ascended before and want a challenge.
*Alignment: Neutral.*

**Valkyrie.** You start with a long sword, a small shield, and cold
resistance. Valkyries are widely considered one of the most
beginner-friendly roles: strong combat stats, good starting equipment,
and cold resistance covers one of the more common damage types. If
you're lawful, you can dip your long sword in a fountain at experience
level 5 or higher for a chance at Excalibur. This is the
recommendation for your first serious attempt.
*Alignment: Lawful or Neutral.*

**Wizard.** You start with a quarterstaff and a spellbook or two. Your
physical combat is terrible, but you have access to the deepest magic
in the game. Wizards are extremely powerful in the late game but very
fragile early on. You'll lean heavily on your spells and need to find
ways to avoid melee combat until you're strong enough to dominate it.
If you enjoy resource management and creative problem-solving, the
Wizard is deeply satisfying. *Alignment: Neutral or Chaotic.*

#### The Races

Your race affects your starting attributes, maximum attributes, and
which intrinsics you begin with or can gain.

**Human.** You know what a human is. No infravision, no poison
resistance, no particular talents. On the bright side, every role is
open to you, and nobody in the dungeon singles you out for being one.
Perfectly serviceable.

**Dwarf.** Dwarves are sturdy and strong, with infravision (they can
see warm-blooded creatures in the dark). They're good fighters and
have an affinity for mining. Available for: Archeologist, Cave Dweller,
Valkyrie.

**Elf.** Elves get sleep resistance, infravision, and a natural
affinity for bows. They're a bit more fragile than humans but have
excellent dexterity. Available for: Ranger, Wizard.

**Gnome.** Gnomes get infravision and are comfortable underground.
They're small but resourceful. Available for: Archeologist, Cave
Dweller, Healer, Ranger, Wizard.

**Orc.** Orcs get infravision and poison resistance, which is genuinely
useful. They tend to have high strength but low charisma. The trade-off
is that some shopkeepers are less friendly. Available for: Barbarian,
Ranger, Rogue, Wizard.

#### Alignment

Your alignment (Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic) determines which gods
you worship, which artifacts you can safely use, and how certain
actions affect your standing. It's tempting to think of these as
"good," "balanced," and "evil," but it's more nuanced than that.

The key thing to understand about alignment is that it's a number.
Every action that matches your alignment's expectations increases it;
actions that violate your alignment's code decrease it. Your alignment
record affects your relationship with your god, which in turn affects
whether prayer will save you or smite you.

**Lawful** characters should avoid attacking peaceful creatures and
should never murder. Sacrifice frequently at co-aligned altars.
Lawful has the advantage of access to Excalibur, one of the best
weapons in the game, obtainable as early as experience level 5.

**Neutral** characters have the most flexibility. You can get away
with more than a Lawful character, but your god still frowns on
truly chaotic behavior. Neutral has access to some excellent quest
artifacts.

**Chaotic** characters can kill with relative impunity but should
avoid pious behavior that doesn't match their dark patron's
expectations. Chaotic is often paired with Rogue for thematic
consistency.

For your first game: **Lawful Valkyrie, Human or Dwarf.** Strong
combat, cold resistance, and the Excalibur path. It's the closest
thing to an easy mode the Mazes offer, which is to say it's still
very hard.

### What to Pack

Any good travel guide will tell you what to bring. Ours has the
awkward job of telling you that you don't get to choose. Your
starting kit is determined by your role, and you'll descend with
whatever your role provides, no more.

What you *can* choose is what to prioritize once you're down there.
Every role starts with equipment suited to its strengths. The
important thing isn't what's in your pack on turn one; it's knowing
what to scavenge from the first few levels to shore up your
weaknesses.

#### The Early Shopping List

No matter your role, here's what you should be looking for:

**A source of nutrition.** You will get hungry. It happens faster than
you think. Food rations are the gold standard: 800 nutrition each,
they never spoil. Grab every food ration you see. If you're a role
that starts with tripe rations, those are fine for your pet but
genuinely unpleasant for you. Eat them only if you must.

**A way to identify things.** In the early game, your primary
identification tools are altars (drop items to see if they flash
blessed/cursed), your pet (it won't step on cursed items), and
experimentation. A scroll of identify is valuable, but you might not
find one for a while. A touchstone (a gray stone that identifies gems)
is helpful but not urgent.

**Armor improvements.** Whatever you're wearing, you can probably do
better. Look for cloaks, helmets, gloves, and boots to fill empty
equipment slots. Even basic items like a helmet or pair of gloves
provide armor class benefits and can protect against specific attacks.

**A ranged attack.** Daggers, darts, or a bow with arrows. Fighting
from range is almost always safer than melee, and some monsters (like
floating eyes) should never be fought in melee at all.

**A light source.** Many areas of the dungeon are dark, and bumbling
around blind is a recipe for walking into things you'd rather see
coming. An oil lamp or magic lamp is ideal. A candle or two will do
in a pinch.

---

### Your First Descent

You step down the stairs. The air is cool and damp. A corridor
stretches before you, branching into darkness. Your pet (a little dog
or kitten, depending on your inclinations) trots along behind you.

Welcome to the dungeon.

The first few levels of the Mazes are designed to ease you in, which
is a relative term. Monsters are weaker, but you are too. Your gear is
minimal, your hit points are low, and you don't yet have the
resistances that make the mid-game survivable. More experienced
adventurers will tell you that levels one through five are where the
most characters die, not because the threats are the greatest, but
because you have the fewest resources to deal with them.

#### The Golden Rules of Early Survival

**Rule 1: Don't fight what you can't beat.** This sounds obvious, but
it's the single most violated principle in the Mazes. If a monster is
too tough for you, walk away. Use corridors as chokepoints. Funnel
enemies so you fight them one at a time. If you stumble into a room
full of monsters, step back into the corridor and force them to come
to you in single file.

```
  Bad: fighting in the open        Good: corridor chokepoint

  ┌─────·──────┐                   ┌─────·──────┐
  │·Z··Z·······│                   │·Z···Z······│
  │··Z·@·Z·Z···│                   │··Z··Z······│
  │····Z·······│                   │·Z··········+##@
  │··Z·········│                   │··Z·········│
  └────────────┘                   └────────────┘

  You're surrounded.               They come to you one at a time.
```

**Rule 2: Don't eat things you don't understand.** Monster corpses
can grant powerful intrinsics, or they can poison you, give you food
poisoning, or worse. Until you know what a corpse does, leave it on
the ground. The exceptions: you can always safely eat food rations,
lembas wafers, cram rations, and fruits. Lichen corpses are safe and
never rot. Lizard corpses are safe, never rot, and cure
petrification. Always carry one if you can.

**Rule 3: Your pet is your friend.** Your starting pet is more useful
than it appears. It will fight alongside you, pick up items (which
tells you they're not cursed, since pets avoid cursed items on the ground),
and can even be trained to steal from shops. Keep it fed by dropping
tripe rations or corpses near it. A healthy, well-fed pet is one of
your best early assets.

**Rule 4: Learn to pray.** If you are about to die (hit points
critically low, starving, turning to stone) you
can pray to your god for help. In the early game, with decent
alignment, prayer will almost certainly save you. But you can only
pray about once every 300-500 turns, and praying at the wrong time
(when your god is angry, when you're in Gehennom, or when you've
prayed too recently) can make things much worse. Think of prayer as an
emergency button with a cooldown. Don't waste it on minor problems.
We'll cover the details in [Divine Relations](#divine-relations).

**Rule 5: Explore thoroughly but move purposefully.** Every turn you
spend in the dungeon costs nutrition. If you stand around for hundreds
of turns, you'll starve. But rushing past rooms means missing
items you need. The sweet spot is to explore each level fairly
completely (check rooms, open doors, look for hidden passages) but
don't grind. When you've found what the level has to offer, move on.

#### Things That Will Kill You (And How to Avoid Them)

Here's a short list of common early deaths and how to prevent them:

**Starvation.** Eat when you're Hungry (the status message), not
when you're Weak or Fainting. If you're Fainting, pray immediately.
Pick up every food ration you find.

**Floating eyes.** They're the `e` on the map. Small, blue, and
seemingly harmless. If you hit one in melee, you'll be paralyzed, and
every monster in the vicinity will take free shots at your frozen body.
Use ranged attacks, or just walk around them. They don't pursue you.

**Rotted corpses.** If you eat a corpse that's been on the ground too
long, you'll get food poisoning, which is lethal without treatment.
Eat corpses fresh (within a few turns of the kill) or not at all.
If you do get food poisoning, pray immediately.

**Falling down stairs while overburdened.** If you're carrying too
much, taking the stairs can cause you to tumble and take significant
damage. Drop items before descending, or manage your inventory.

**Killer bees.** They come in swarms, they're fast, and in the early
game, a group of them can overwhelm you. If you see one bee, expect
more. Use a corridor to fight them one at a time.

**Your own pet.** If your pet is between you and a narrow corridor,
you might accidentally swap places with it repeatedly instead of
moving. Worse, if you attack it (because you got confused or forgot
it was there), you lose alignment and trust. Be aware of where your
pet is.

## Part Two: Reading the Terrain

### The Lay of the Land

The Mazes are procedurally generated. No two visits are quite the
same. But the dungeon follows patterns, and understanding those
patterns is the first step toward navigating them effectively.

#### The Big Picture

Before we talk about what the symbols mean, here's the overall
shape of the place. The dungeon is a branching tree, and knowing
where you are in it helps you plan your route:

```
  Dungeons of Doom (levels 1-29ish)
    │
    ├── The Gnomish Mines (branch around level 2-4)
    │     ├── Minetown (shops and a temple)
    │     └── Mine's End (bottom: luckstone)
    │
    ├── Sokoban (branch around level 5-9, goes UP)
    │     └── Top: bag of holding or amulet of reflection
    │
    ├── Your Quest (portal around level 11-16)
    │     └── Unique to your role. Get your quest artifact.
    │
    ├── Fort Ludios (portal, if you find it)
    │     └── A vault full of gold and soldiers
    │
    ├── Medusa's Island (level ~25)
    │
    └── The Castle (level ~27, bottom of Dungeons of Doom)
          │
  Gehennom (levels 28-50ish)
    │
    ├── Vlad's Tower (contains the Candelabrum)
    │
    ├── The Wizard's Tower (Wizard of Yendor, Book of the Dead)
    │
    └── Moloch's Sanctum (bottom: the Amulet of Yendor)
          │
          (now go ALL the way back up)
          │
          The Elemental Planes
            Earth ─► Air ─► Fire ─► Water
              │
              The Astral Plane (three altars, pick the right one)
                │
                ASCENSION
```

The typical trip: go down through the Dungeons, detour into the
Mines for a luckstone and Minetown's shops, clear Sokoban for a
prize, do your Quest, reach the Castle, descend through Gehennom
to get the Amulet, then climb all the way back up and through the
Planes. Simple enough on paper. Surviving it is another matter.

#### The Map Symbols

Everything in the dungeon is represented by a symbol on the screen.
Learning to read these symbols quickly is essential:

| Symbol   | Meaning                       |
| -------- | ----------------------------- |
| `.`      | Floor (room)                  |
| `#`      | Corridor                      |
| `-`  `│` | Wall (horizontal, vertical)   |
| `+`      | Closed door (or spellbook)    |
| `<`      | Stairs up                     |
| `>`      | Stairs down                   |
| `{`      | Fountain                      |
| `_`      | Altar                         |
| `\`      | Throne                        |
| `#`      | Sink (in a kitchen)           |
| `^`      | Trap (once revealed)          |
| `@`      | You (or a human-type monster) |

Letters represent monsters: `d` for dogs, `D` for dragons, `Z` for
zombies. Colors help distinguish within a class: a red `D` is a red
dragon, while a gray `D` is a gray dragon. We'll cover this in detail
in [A Field Guide to Dungeon Fauna](#a-field-guide-to-dungeon-fauna).

Item symbols are punctuation marks:

| Symbol | Item Class         |
| ------ | ------------------ |
| `)`    | Weapons            |
| `[`    | Armor              |
| `%`    | Food (comestibles) |
| `!`    | Potions            |
| `?`    | Scrolls            |
| `/`    | Wands              |
| `=`    | Rings              |
| `"`    | Amulets            |
| `(`    | Tools              |
| `+`    | Spellbooks         |
| `*`    | Gems and stones    |
| `$`    | Gold               |

#### Room Types

Most rooms in the dungeon are ordinary, empty or with a few items
and monsters scattered about. But some rooms are special:

```
  A shop:                 A zoo:                  A throne room:
  ┌───────┐               ┌────────┐              ┌────────┐
  │··[·?!·│               │Z··Z$Z··│              │··Z·Z·Z·│
  │···@···│               │$Z···$Z·│              │·Z·\··Z·│
  │!··)·/·│               │·Z$Z··Z$│              │··Z·Z···│
  └──+────┘               └───+────┘              └───+────┘
      #                       #                       #
  @ = shopkeeper          Z = sleeping monsters    \ = throne
  Items are for sale.     $ = piles of gold        Monsters guard it.
```

**Shops.** Identified by the shopkeeper standing in the doorway (or
inside). Shops sell items of a particular type: general
stores, armor shops, weapon shops, scroll shops, potion shops, and
more. Items on the shop floor belong to the shopkeeper; pick one up
and you'll be quoted a price. You can sell items too. Shopkeepers are
extremely powerful in combat, so don't steal unless you have a plan.

**Temples.** A room with an altar and a priest or priestess tending
it. The altar's alignment matters: if it matches yours, you can
sacrifice here for good effects. If it doesn't, the resident priest
won't be friendly about your attempts.

**Throne rooms.** A room with a throne (`\`) and usually surrounded
by monsters. Sitting on the throne has random effects, sometimes
wonderful, sometimes terrible. See
[Points of Interest](#points-of-interest).

**Zoos.** A room packed with sleeping monsters and gold. If you open
the door, they all wake up. Fight from the doorway and pick them off
one at a time.

**Barracks.** A room full of soldiers. They're organized and armed,
but they're also carrying good equipment. Worth clearing if you can
handle the fight.

**Beehives.** A room full of killer bees and royal jelly. The bees
are dangerous in numbers, but royal jelly is excellent food.

**Themed rooms.** Newer editions of the dungeon include a variety
of themed rooms: collections of specific monster types, item caches,
and environmental setups. These are too varied to catalog completely
here, but they add welcome variety to the standard layout.

---

### Points of Interest

The dungeon contains several types of special features worth knowing
about. Each offers both opportunities and risks.

#### Fountains `{`

Fountains are sources of water that can be quaffed from or dipped
into. Both actions carry risk and reward.

**Quaffing from a fountain** has many possible outcomes:

| Outcome         | Effect                                                |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Wish granted    | A water demon appears and grants a wish (rare, ~1/30) |
| Water demon     | A hostile water demon appears                         |
| Healing         | You regain hit points                                 |
| Attribute boost | A random attribute increases                          |
| Attribute loss  | A random attribute decreases                          |
| Water moccasin  | Snakes appear                                         |
| See invisible   | You gain the ability to see invisible creatures       |
| Nothing         | "The water is cool and refreshing"                    |

**Dipping in a fountain** is most notable for one thing: if you are
Lawful and at least experience level 5, dipping a long sword may
transform it into Excalibur, one of the best weapons in the game.
Otherwise, dipping can rust metallic items, create hostile water
creatures, or occasionally bless the dipped item.

The conventional wisdom is: if you're a lawful character with a long
sword, dip in every fountain you find until you get Excalibur. If
you're not lawful, fountains are mostly a trap. The risks outweigh
the benefits.

#### Altars `_`

Altars are among the most useful features in the dungeon, especially
for identification.

**Dropping items on an altar** reveals their blessed/cursed/uncursed
status:
- **Amber flash** → the item is blessed
- **Black flash** → the item is cursed
- No flash → the item is uncursed

This is the cheapest and most reliable way to check items in the
early game. Always clear a path to an altar and ferry suspicious
items there for testing.

**Sacrificing monster corpses on an altar** builds your relationship
with your god. Fresh corpses are required (old ones won't do). The
bigger the monster, the better the sacrifice. Eventually, sufficient
sacrifice may summon an artifact weapon aligned to your cause. See
[Divine Relations](#divine-relations) for full details.

**Converting an altar** is possible by offering a same-race corpse of
a different alignment on it. This is useful if you find an altar that
doesn't match your alignment.

#### Thrones `\`

Sitting on a throne is a gamble. The possible effects include:

- A wish (if your luck is positive)
- Genocide of a monster class
- Free identification of items in your pack
- A stat boost or stat drain
- An electric shock
- Full healing
- Summoning a crowd of hostile monsters
- Confusion
- A curse on one of your items
- Magic mapping of the level
- Gaining see invisible
- Losing all your gold

The odds aren't terrible (about one in six for something to happen
at all) but the variance is wild. Sit on a throne when you can
afford to deal with the worst outcome.

#### Sinks `#`

Sinks are found in kitchens and have a few uses:

- **Kicking a sink** can produce a black pudding (dangerous!) or a
  ring, or just hurt your foot
- **Quaffing from a sink** can have various minor effects
- **Dropping a ring down a sink** produces a characteristic message
  that can help identify the ring type. This is one of the more
  reliable non-magical identification methods for rings

### Branches and Landmarks

The branch diagram we showed earlier gives the shape of the dungeon,
but it doesn't tell you what to actually do when you arrive. Here's
a more practical tour, in roughly the order you'll visit these places.

#### The Gnomish Mines

The entrance appears somewhere around dungeon levels 2 through 4, as
a downward staircase. You'll know you're in the Mines because the
walls become rough stone and the corridors get irregular.

The Mines are populated primarily by gnomes, dwarves, and the
occasional dwarf lord. If you're playing a gnomish character, most
of them will be peaceful, which makes the Mines a relatively
comfortable detour. Everyone else will need to fight through a
modest but steady stream of hostile gnomes.

**Minetown** appears a few levels into the Mines. It's a small
settlement with shops and a temple, and it's worth visiting early.
The shops let you sell unwanted items for gold and buy useful gear.
The temple has an altar (check the alignment) and a resident priest.
If the altar matches your alignment, you've found a safe place to
identify items by dropping them on it.

Watch out for the Minetown watch. The guards are peaceful unless
you steal from a shop or attack a peaceful creature. If you anger
them, they'll call for reinforcements.

**Mine's End** is the bottom of the Mines. One of its level variants
contains a guaranteed luckstone, which you very much want. A
luckstone in your open inventory prevents your luck from timing out
toward zero, which affects everything from combat to fountain wishes.
Grab it and carry it for the rest of the game.

#### Sokoban

The entrance appears somewhere around dungeon levels 5 through 9,
and it goes up. Sokoban is a set of four puzzle levels where you
push boulders onto holes or into place to open a path. No teleport
works here, and you can't dig through the floors.

The puzzles are fixed (two variants per level, randomly chosen).
Each level has exactly one correct solution. If you push a boulder
into a corner where it blocks your progress, you're stuck and will
need to start the level over. The game won't warn you about this.

The prize at the top is either a **bag of holding** or an
**amulet of reflection**, both extremely valuable. Which one you
get depends on the level variant. A bag of holding lets you carry
far more inventory at reduced weight. An amulet of reflection
bounces ray attacks back at their casters. Either one is worth
the detour.

One important rule: the Sokoban levels penalize you for taking the
stairs back down. Each time you go down a staircase in Sokoban, you
lose one point of luck. Solve each level in one visit if you can.
For complete solutions to all eight level variants, see
[Sokoban Solutions](#sokoban-solutions) in the appendices.

#### The Quest

Around dungeon levels 11 through 16, you'll find a magic portal to
your Quest. But you can't enter it immediately. You need to be at
least experience level 14, and you need to have spoken to your quest
leader (who appears on the first Quest level). The leader sends you
to retrieve your role's quest artifact from a quest nemesis.

Each role has a unique Quest with unique maps, a unique nemesis, and
a unique artifact reward. The Valkyrie hunts the Orb of Fate. The
Wizard retrieves the Eye of the Aethiopica. The Tourist battles the
Master of Thieves for the Platinum Yendorian Express Card. And so on.

Quest artifacts are powerful. Most provide magic resistance, which
you absolutely need. Some provide other useful properties like
telepathy or warning. Getting your quest artifact is a milestone
that marks the transition from "surviving" to "preparing for the
endgame."

If your alignment record is too low (from attacking peacefuls, for
instance), your quest leader will refuse to send you. Keep your
hands clean.

#### Fort Ludios

Fort Ludios is optional and easy to miss entirely. It appears as a
magic portal somewhere in the dungeon, often behind a wall that
requires digging to reach. The portal leads to a fortified military
compound filled with soldiers, lieutenants, captains, and a whole
lot of gold.

The fort is guarded heavily. Soldiers come in numbers, and they
carry useful items: C-rations, K-rations, and sometimes decent
weapons. The real prize is the gold (thousands of pieces) and the
occasional chest. This is a good place to visit if you need money
for protection rackets or shop purchases, but it's not essential
for victory.

If you can't find the portal, don't worry about it. Fort Ludios is
a bonus, not a requirement.

#### Medusa's Island

Medusa's level sits near the bottom of the Dungeons of Doom, around
level 25. You'll know it by the large body of water and the
statues scattered around (those used to be adventurers).

The level has three challenges stacked together:

1. **Crossing the water.** The island is surrounded by water.
   You'll need levitation, water walking boots, or some creative
   approach (freezing water with a wand of cold, building a boulder
   bridge, polymorphing into a flying creature). Don't wade in
   without preparation, because:

2. **Giant eels.** The water is home to giant eels that can grab
   and drown you if you're burdened. Stay unburdened while crossing,
   or avoid the water entirely.

3. **Medusa herself.** Her gaze turns you to stone. You need
   either **reflection** (a shield of reflection or amulet of
   reflection bounces the gaze back, stoning her instead) or
   **blindness** (you can't meet her gaze if you can't see). A
   mirror also works if you apply it at her. Reflection is the
   cleanest solution. If you got the amulet of reflection from
   Sokoban, you're already prepared.

There is a downward staircase (or ladder) on the island itself
that leads toward the Castle.

#### The Castle

The Castle is the last level of the Dungeons of Doom proper, around
level 27. It's a large fortified structure surrounded by a moat,
with a drawbridge as the main entrance. A maze section to the
side contains a minotaur.

To enter the Castle, you need to open the drawbridge. Options:

- **Play the passtune.** A five-note musical sequence played on a
  tonal instrument (a tooled horn, bugle, or magic harp) opens
  the drawbridge. The notes are randomized per game. You can learn
  them by trying different sequences: the game tells you how many
  notes are correct after each attempt, like a game of Mastermind.
- **Wand of opening** pointed at the drawbridge.
- **Spell of knock** cast at the drawbridge.
- **Wand of striking** on the portcullis.

Inside the Castle, you'll find a throne room, barracks, and several
treasure chambers. One of those chambers contains a **wand of
wishing**, typically with three charges. This is one of the most
important items in the game. Use your wishes wisely (see
[Wishes and Wishing](#wishes-and-wishing)).

Below the Castle lies Gehennom. There is no going back to the
upper dungeon once you descend without climbing back up through
everything. Make sure you're prepared before you go down.

#### The Oracle

Somewhere in the mid-levels of the Dungeons of Doom (around levels
5 through 9), you'll find a special room containing the Oracle of
Delphi, flanked by centaur statues and a fountain.

The Oracle offers two services:

- **Minor consultations** are cheap and produce fortune-cookie-style
  messages, occasionally useful but mostly atmospheric.
- **Major consultations** are expensive but provide genuinely
  helpful gameplay information: hints about monsters, items, and
  game mechanics.

The Oracle is peaceful and never attacks. Her room is a safe place
to rest for a moment, though the fountain is subject to the usual
fountain risks.

### Traps and Hazards

The dungeon is littered with traps, represented by `^` on the map
once you've discovered them. Traps are invisible until you step on
one, detect it with a search, or reveal it by other means. Searching
(the `s` command) in a square adjacent to a trap has a chance of
revealing it each time, but the chance is not 100%, so search
repeatedly if you suspect traps.

Pets are useful trap detectors. A pet will hesitate to step on a
known trap, so watch your pet's movement for clues.

Here are the traps you'll encounter, roughly grouped by severity:

#### Nuisance Traps

| Trap            | Effect                                              |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Arrow trap      | Fires an arrow at you (modest damage)               |
| Dart trap       | Fires a dart, may be poisoned                       |
| Squeaky board   | Makes noise, wakes nearby monsters                  |
| Rust trap       | Splashes water, rusting exposed metal equipment     |
| Rolling boulder | A boulder rolls at you (dodge or take heavy damage) |

These traps are annoying but rarely lethal on their own. Arrow and
dart traps have the small upside of producing ammunition you can
collect afterward.

#### Movement Traps

| Trap             | Effect                                                     |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pit              | You fall in, take minor damage, can climb out              |
| Spiked pit       | Like a pit, but with spikes (more damage, possible poison) |
| Trapdoor         | Drops you to the next level down                           |
| Teleport trap    | Teleports you randomly on the level                        |
| Level teleporter | Teleports you to a random dungeon level                    |
| Hole             | Like a trapdoor, but you can see it                        |
| Magic portal     | Transports to a different branch (branch entrances)        |

Trapdoors and level teleporters are the most disruptive. They can
separate you from your pet and your carefully explored map. If you
have teleport control (from an item or intrinsic), teleport traps
become convenient transportation instead.

Levitation makes you immune to pit traps and holes.

#### Dangerous Traps

| Trap              | Effect                                               |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Land mine         | Explosion, heavy damage, items can be destroyed      |
| Bear trap         | Holds you in place until you escape                  |
| Sleeping gas trap | Puts you to sleep (helpless for several turns)       |
| Fire trap         | Burns you, destroys scrolls and potions in inventory |
| Magic trap        | Random magical effects (some good, some very bad)    |
| Anti-magic field  | Drains your magical energy to zero                   |
| Polymorph trap    | Polymorphs you into a random creature                |

Fire traps are the sleeper threat here. A fire trap that ignites
when you're carrying a stack of scrolls of identify or potions of
healing can ruin your day. Fire resistance prevents the damage to
you but doesn't protect inventory.

Polymorph traps can be useful if you know what you're doing (and
have polymorph control), but without control, you'll become
something random and possibly unable to use your equipment.

Sleeping gas traps are deadly in areas with monsters, since you'll
be unconscious and unable to fight back while they hit you.

#### Searching and Detection

The best defense against traps is finding them before they find you.

- **Search (`s`)** in place to check adjacent squares. Each search
  has an independent chance to reveal each adjacent trap, so search
  multiple times. Your Luck affects the detection chance.
- **Wand of secret door detection** reveals traps in its path.
- **Crystal ball** can reveal traps on the level.
- **Pets** will avoid known traps, giving behavioral clues.
- **Flying and levitation** make you immune to most floor traps.

In corridors where traps are common (especially around dungeon
level 5 and below), a quick search before stepping into a new
corridor segment can save you from unpleasant surprises.

#### Elbereth

> *The mechanics below are drawn from Kate Nepveu's Elbereth FAQ
> (2001, updated 2002), one of the clearest single-topic guides in
> the NetHack community. Kate also maintained steelypips.org, the
> long-running archive that preserved decades of community spoilers.*

Elbereth is not a trap, but it belongs in a chapter about dungeon
hazards because it is your best defense against many of them.

Writing the word "Elbereth" on the ground (using the engrave
command, `E`) creates a protective ward. Most monsters will not
attack you in melee while you stand on an Elbereth square. This
applies whether you wrote it or found it already engraved.

Elbereth has rules:

- **It only works while you stand on it.** Step off and the
  protection ends.
- **Attacking a monster erases it.** If you fight back, the word
  smudges and you lose protection. This means Elbereth is
  defensive only.
- **Some monsters ignore it.** Anything represented by `@` (humans,
  elves, player-like creatures), the Riders on the Astral Plane,
  Angels, minotaurs, and blind monsters all disregard Elbereth.
- **Durability varies.** Writing in dust (with your finger) is
  fast but erases easily. Burning with a wand of fire or lightning
  is permanent. Engraving with a hard gem or edged weapon falls
  in between. A dull weapon may not finish all seven letters.

The practical use: when things go badly and you need a moment to
recover (quaff a healing potion, read a scroll, use an escape
item), write Elbereth in the dust and stand on it. Most monsters
will back off, giving you a turn to act. It works in most of the
dungeon, and it costs nothing.

## Part Three: The Locals

### A Field Guide to Dungeon Fauna

The Mazes are home to hundreds of monster species, organized into
classes denoted by letters. Lowercase letters are generally smaller
or less dangerous; uppercase letters are larger or more threatening.
Color further distinguishes individual species within a class.

Here is a quick field guide to what each letter means, roughly ordered
by how early you might encounter them:

#### Common Early Encounters

| Symbol | Class     | Notes                                                                                   |
| ------ | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `a`    | Ants      | Come in groups. Soldier ants are fast and hit hard.                                     |
| `b`    | Blobs     | Acidic or gelatinous. Don't hit acid blobs in melee.                                    |
| `d`    | Dogs      | Often your starting pet. Tame dogs are loyal. Wild ones are manageable.                 |
| `e`    | Eyes      | **Floating eyes paralyze on melee hit.** Never hit an `e` in melee. Use ranged attacks. |
| `f`    | Cats      | Like dogs, often starting pets. Felines can be tamed with tripe.                        |
| `g`    | Gnomes    | Common in the Mines. Usually peaceful if you're a gnome.                                |
| `h`    | Humanoids | Dwarves, bugbears, mind flayers. Wide range of difficulty.                              |
| `i`    | Imps      | Minor pests. Can steal and teleport.                                                    |
| `j`    | Jellies   | Spotted and ochre jellies. Passive acid damage on melee.                                |
| `k`    | Kobolds   | Weak individually but sometimes carry poisoned weapons.                                 |
| `r`    | Rodents   | Rats and rock moles. Rock moles eat metal items, so protect your gear.                  |
| `s`    | Spiders   | Cave spiders are weak. Giant spiders poison.                                            |
| `:`    | Lizards   | Important! Lizard corpses cure petrification. Always carry one.                         |

#### Mid-Dungeon Threats

| Symbol | Class             | Notes                                                                                                |
| ------ | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `A`    | Angels            | Powerful, usually aligned. Don't fight your own.                                                     |
| `C`    | Centaurs          | Fast, good archers. Mountain centaurs hit hard.                                                      |
| `E`    | Elementals        | Hard to kill. Air elementals engulf; earth elementals phase through walls.                           |
| `F`    | Fungi             | Yellow mold, green mold, shriekers. Shriekers summon other monsters.                                 |
| `G`    | Gnome lords/kings | Tougher gnomes. Still fairly manageable.                                                             |
| `H`    | Giants            | Strong melee, throw boulders. Giants carry gems.                                                     |
| `L`    | Liches            | Spellcasters. Arch-liches are among the most dangerous monsters in the game.                         |
| `M`    | Mummies           | Drain experience on hit. Mummy wrappings are useless but the corpses give cold resistance sometimes. |
| `N`    | Nymphs            | Steal items from your inventory, then teleport away. Fight from range.                               |
| `O`    | Ogres             | Strong melee fighters. Ogre lords and kings are tougher.                                             |
| `P`    | Puddings          | Black puddings split when hit with iron weapons. Don't use iron.                                     |
| `S`    | Snakes            | Cobras and pit vipers poison. Water moccasins come from fountains.                                   |
| `T`    | Trolls            | Regenerate. They come back from the dead unless you eat or tin the corpse.                           |
| `U`    | Umber hulk        | Confuses on sight. Avoid looking at them directly.                                                   |
| `W`    | Wraiths           | Drain levels on hit. But their corpses grant a level, so eat them fresh.                             |
| `Y`    | Yetis             | Tough melee combatants. Corpses may grant cold resistance.                                           |
| `Z`    | Zombies           | Slow, numerous, come in many varieties. Zombie corpses are old and will rot.                         |

#### Things You Don't Want to Meet

| Symbol | Class            | Notes                                                                                                    |
| ------ | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `c`    | Cockatrices      | **Touch = instant petrification.** Never hit one barehanded. Wield their corpse with gloves as a weapon. |
| `D`    | Dragons          | Each color has a different breath weapon and resistance. Gray dragons are prized for scale mail.         |
| `h`    | Mind flayers     | Drain intelligence on hit. **If Int reaches 0, you die.** Keep distance or kill fast.                    |
| `V`    | Vampires         | Drain levels. Vampire lords fly and are fast.                                                            |
| `;`    | Sea monsters     | Drowning is an instadeath. Don't fight in water without a plan.                                          |
| `&`    | Demons           | Major demons (Orcus, Demogorgon, Asmodeus) are boss-level threats.                                       |
| `@`    | Humans (hostile) | Includes the Wizard of Yendor, who is the most persistent nuisance in the game.                          |

We'll cover specific monsters in much more detail in the individual
sections. For now, remember the essentials: **never melee a floating
eye, always carry a lizard corpse, and respect anything with `D` or
`&` on your screen.**

### Dangerous Encounters

> Instadeath Spoiler, compiled from RGRN posts and Dylan O'Donnell's

Some things in the Mazes kill you outright. Not by whittling down
your hit points, not by wearing you down over time, but by ending
your life in a single move with no second chance. These are called
instadeaths, and learning to recognize the situations that produce
them is the difference between a promising run and a one-line
epitaph.

#### Petrification (Stoning)

Anything involving cockatrices or Medusa. Touching a cockatrice
without gloves, eating a cockatrice corpse, being hit by Medusa's
gaze, or even stepping on a cockatrice corpse while barefoot will
turn you to stone. The process can be immediate or delayed (you'll
see the message "You are slowing down" with a few turns to act).

**Defenses:** Wear gloves when handling cockatrice corpses. Carry
a lizard corpse at all times (eating it cures stoning in progress).
Use reflection against Medusa. Stoning resistance (from eating an
acid blob or certain other sources) makes you immune.

**The other side of the coin:** a wielded cockatrice corpse (with
gloves on) is one of the most devastating weapons in the game.
Anything you hit with it that lacks stoning resistance turns to
stone.

#### Drowning

Giant eels and krakens can grab you and pull you underwater. If
you're burdened or worse when grabbed, you can drown before you
get a turn to respond. This happens most often at Medusa's level
and in the endgame.

**Defenses:** Stay unburdened near water. An amulet of magical
breathing lets you survive underwater. Levitation keeps you above
the water entirely. Kill sea monsters at range whenever possible.

#### The Touch of Death

Some monsters, most notably Death (one of the Riders on the Astral
Plane), can kill you with a single touch. The Finger of Death spell
and the wand of death work similarly.

**Defenses:** Magic resistance blocks the touch of death and the
wand/spell. It does not block Death himself (the Rider), who is a
special case. An amulet of life saving will revive you once.

#### Starvation

This isn't technically instant, but it feels like it. If your
nutrition drops to zero, you faint. If you don't eat something while
fainted, you die. In the early game before you've established a food
supply, starvation is a real threat.

**Defenses:** Eat corpses promptly. Pray when your god is willing
and you are Weak or Fainting (prayer cures hunger). Carry food
rations, tripe rations, or lembas wafers. Don't let nutrition
management slide.

#### Brainlessness

Mind flayers drain Intelligence with their tentacle attacks. If
your Intelligence reaches zero, you die instantly. In current
editions, mind flayers no longer cause amnesia, but the Intelligence
drain is still lethal if unchecked.

**Defenses:** Wear a greased helmet to prevent tentacle attacks
from connecting. Kill mind flayers at range (wands, spells). Use a
unicorn horn or other means to restore lost Intelligence before it
reaches critical levels.

#### Choking

If you eat while already satiated, you can choke and die. The game
warns you ("You're having a hard time getting all of it down"), but
if you confirm, you're dead.

**Defense:** Don't eat when satiated. Just don't.

#### Deadly Poison

A handful of monsters (pit vipers, some spiders) have instantly
lethal poison attacks. The chance is low but nonzero. Eating
certain corpses (Death, Pestilence) is also instantly fatal poison.

**Defenses:** Poison resistance makes you immune. Most characters
can get this early by eating enough appropriate corpses. It's one
of the first intrinsics worth acquiring.

#### Disintegration

A black dragon's breath weapon disintegrates you. Touching a
wide-angle disintegration beam also kills.

**Defenses:** Disintegration resistance (from eating a black dragon
corpse or wearing black dragon scale mail). Reflection bounces the
beam back. Magic resistance does NOT protect against disintegration.

#### Genocide

Reading a scroll of genocide while confused can genocide your own
race. Don't do this.

#### The Amulet of Life Saving

This deserves special mention. An amulet of life saving, when worn,
revives you once from any death (including instadeaths). The amulet
is consumed in the process. If you find one, save it for the
endgame or for situations where instadeath risk is high. It's your
insurance policy.

#### The Essential Kit

The short version: you need **magic resistance**, **reflection**,
**poison resistance**, and a **lizard corpse** to survive the
dungeon's worst surprises. Get these as early as you can. Everything
else is luxury. These are survival.

### Making Friends

Not everything in the Mazes wants to kill you. Some creatures can
be tamed, and a tame creature is one of the most useful assets
you can have.

#### Starting Pets

Most roles begin the game with a pet: either a little dog or a
kitten, depending on your role. Your starting pet is loyal, follows
you between levels (if adjacent when you take stairs), and will
fight on your behalf. It will also pick up items and eat food it
finds.

A pet that eats enough and fights enough will grow. A little dog
becomes a dog, then a large dog. A kitten becomes a housecat, then
a large cat. Grown pets are substantially more dangerous in combat.

Your pet will not step on cursed items willingly. This is one of
the cheapest ways to detect cursed items in the early game: drop
items on the ground and see if your pet avoids them.

#### Feeding and Loyalty

Pets have a tameness score that decreases over time and when they
take damage. If tameness reaches zero, the pet goes feral. Feeding
your pet keeps tameness high:

- **Dogs** eat tripe rations and most meat.
- **Cats** eat tripe rations and most meat.
- **Horses** eat apples, carrots, and other vegetarian food.

Tripe rations are ideal for dogs and cats. You'll find them
scattered through the dungeon. When you see one, pick it up even
if you don't want to eat it yourself (it's terrible food for
humans, but pets love it).

If your pet dies, you can tame a new creature. The most common
method is throwing appropriate food at a suitable animal.

#### Taming New Creatures

Several methods work:

- **Throwing food** at a creature appropriate to its diet. Dogs
  and cats take tripe, meat, and other food. Horses take
  vegetarian food.
- **Scroll of taming** tames creatures in a radius around you.
- **Spell of charm monster** tames a single adjacent creature.
- **Magic trap effects** occasionally produce taming.

You can tame most creatures this way, including powerful ones.
A tame purple worm, dragon, or titan is a formidable ally. The
main exceptions are unique monsters (Medusa, the Wizard) and
certain special creatures that resist taming.

#### What Pets Do for You

A well-maintained pet provides several services:

- **Combat.** Pets attack hostile monsters on your behalf. A strong
  pet can clear rooms for you.
- **Cursed item detection.** Pets refuse to step on cursed items,
  which is a free and reliable test.
- **Stealing from shops.** If your pet picks up an item in a shop
  and carries it outside, you haven't technically stolen it. This
  is the cheapest way to acquire expensive shop items. It takes
  patience (the pet must wander onto the item and then wander out
  the door) but costs nothing.
- **Sacrifice fodder.** When a pet kills a monster, the corpse can
  be sacrificed on an altar just as if you'd killed it yourself.

#### Keeping Your Pet Alive

Pets can die from the same things that kill you: traps, poison,
powerful monsters. They can also drown if they follow you across
water. Keep an eye on your pet's health (use the farlook command,
`;`, to check) and avoid leading it into danger it can't handle.

If you change levels and your pet isn't adjacent, it won't follow
you. You'll see the message "You have a sad feeling for a moment."
Your pet is still alive on the level you left, but it will lose
tameness while separated from you. Come back for it before it goes
feral.

### The Identification Problem

Here is the central puzzle of the Mazes, and the thing that kills
more promising expeditions than any monster: you will find dozens of
items, and you won't know what most of them are.

That potion might heal you or it might make you hallucinate. That
scroll could enchant your armor or destroy it. That ring could grant
you invisibility or slowly starve you to death. In the Mazes,
ignorance is not bliss. Ignorance is death by unidentified wand.

Every game, the dungeon shuffles the deck. Potions, scrolls, wands,
rings, amulets, and spellbooks are all given randomized appearances.
The "milky potion" in this game might be healing; in your next game
it might be paralysis. The only things that stay consistent between
games are the item classes themselves (a `!` is always a potion, a
`?` is always a scroll) and the prices, which turn out to be the
single most powerful identification tool you have.

#### Blessed, Uncursed, Cursed

Before you can worry about *what* an item is, you need to know
*what condition* it's in. Every item in the Mazes is blessed, uncursed,
or cursed (BUC for short). This affects how the item behaves, often
dramatically:

- A **blessed** scroll of identify will reveal all items in your pack.
  A cursed one identifies only a single item.
- A **cursed** piece of armor cannot be removed once worn.
- A **cursed** potion of gain level sends you up through the ceiling
  to the level above instead of granting an experience level.

You don't see BUC status by default (Priests are the exception; they
sense it naturally). But there are several reliable ways to check:

**Altar testing.** Drop an item on an altar. An amber flash means
blessed. A black flash means cursed. No flash means uncursed. This is
free, fast, and unlimited. If you find an altar early, use it heavily.

**Pet testing.** Your pet won't step on cursed items. If you drop
something and your dog walks around it, it's cursed. If the dog walks
over it (or picks it up), it's safe. Not as precise as an altar, but
works anywhere.

**Holy water.** Dipping an item in blessed water (holy water) will
uncurse or bless it. Dipping in cursed water (unholy water) will curse
it. Holy water is precious in the early game, so save it for items
you've already identified.

**Scroll of identify.** A blessed scroll of identify will identify
everything in your pack at once. This is the gold standard, but you
need to identify the scroll first (irony noted) and bless it.

#### The Price Is Right

Shopkeepers are, without exaggeration, your most important
identification tool. Every unidentified item has a fixed base price
that depends on what it actually is. When you pick up an item in a
shop, the shopkeeper quotes you a price derived from that base price,
modified by your Charisma and the shopkeeper's markup.

The key insight: items in the same category that share a base price
are in the same **price group**. If you know the price, you can
narrow down the possibilities enormously, sometimes to just two or
three candidates.

Here's how to do it. Pick up an item in a shop and note the price
quoted. The quote will be higher than base price (shopkeepers mark
up). With average Charisma, the sell price is typically one third of
base and the buy price is roughly double. You don't need to memorize
exact formulas. What matters is grouping: items quoted at similar
prices are in the same price tier.

The price tables for each item class follow. These are your
field reference for shopping trips.

##### Scroll Prices

| Base Price | Scrolls                                                                                                           |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $20        | identify                                                                                                          |
| $50        | light                                                                                                             |
| $60        | blank paper, enchant weapon                                                                                       |
| $80        | enchant armor, remove curse                                                                                       |
| $100       | confuse monster, destroy armor, fire, food detection, gold detection, magic mapping, scare monster, teleportation |
| $200       | amnesia, create monster, earth, taming                                                                            |
| $300       | charging, genocide, punishment, stinking cloud                                                                    |

The $100 group is crowded, which makes scroll price-ID less precise
than other categories. But you can still narrow things down. If a
scroll is in the $20 group, it's identify. Period. That's one of the
most useful scrolls in the game and you just found it for free.

##### Potion Prices

| Base Price | Potions                                                                            |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $50        | booze, fruit juice, see invisible, sickness                                        |
| $100       | confusion, extra healing, hallucination, healing, restore ability, sleeping, water |
| $150       | blindness, gain energy, invisibility, monster detection, object detection          |
| $200       | enlightenment, full healing, levitation, polymorph, speed                          |
| $250       | acid, oil                                                                          |
| $300       | gain ability, gain level, paralysis                                                |

Water is always the "clear" potion, so if you see "clear potion" you
know what it is without even checking the price. The $50 group is
tricky because sickness and see invisible are in there together (one
very good, one very bad). The $200 group is packed with excellent
potions.

##### Ring Prices

| Base Price | Rings                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $100       | adornment, hunger, protection, protection from shape changers, stealth, sustain ability, warning                                                                           |
| $150       | aggravate monster, cold resistance, gain constitution, gain strength, increase accuracy, increase damage, invisibility, poison resistance, see invisible, shock resistance |
| $200       | fire resistance, free action, levitation, regeneration, searching, slow digestion, teleportation                                                                           |
| $300       | conflict, polymorph, polymorph control, teleport control                                                                                                                   |

The $300 group is extremely informative: only four rings live there,
and three of them (conflict, polymorph control, teleport control) are
among the most powerful in the game.

##### Wand Prices

| Base Price | Wands                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $100       | light, nothing                                                                                                                                                 |
| $150       | digging, enlightenment, locking, magic missile, make invisible, opening, probing, secret door detection, slow monster, speed monster, striking, undead turning |
| $175       | cold, fire, lightning, sleep                                                                                                                                   |
| $200       | cancellation, create monster, polymorph, teleportation                                                                                                         |
| $500       | death, wishing                                                                                                                                                 |

If a wand costs $500, you are having a very good day.

##### Amulet Prices

All amulets have a base price of $150 except the cheap Amulet of
Yendor imitations ($0). Price doesn't help here. You'll need to rely
on other methods.

#### The Engrave Test (Wands)

This is the single most useful trick for wand identification and
costs you nothing. Apply a wand by engraving on the floor with it
(command: `E`, then select the wand). What happens tells you what
the wand is:

```
  What you see when you engrave:          Wand type
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  "A lit field surrounds you"             light
  Your engraving vanishes                 cancellation/make invisible
  "Bugs appear in the engraving"          create monster  (no bugs)
  You feel self-knowledgeable             enlightenment
  "The engraving in the floor is gone"    polymorph/teleportation
  Your engraving is smudged               secret door detection  (no)
  The floor is riddled by holes           digging
  The bugs on the floor stop moving       sleep
  Lightning strikes the engraving         lightning
  The engraving is covered in frost       cold
  The engraving catches fire              fire
  Nothing happens (but a charge is used)  nothing
  You write in the dust                   all BEAM wands (1 charge used)
```

The engrave test costs one charge per wand but preserves the rest.
With one zap you can sort most wands into clear categories. For BEAM
wands (which just write in the dust like a finger), you'll need
further testing: try zapping them at a monster or in a safe direction.

Crucially, engraving with a wand of wishing does nothing special.
It just uses a charge. So if you suspect you have a wand of wishing
($500 price), do NOT engrave with it. Zap it directly.

#### The Sink Test (Rings)

If you find a sink (usually in a kitchen), you can drop a ring down
it. Each ring type produces a characteristic message:

```
  Message you hear or see:                Ring type
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  "The water flow seems fixed"            sustain ability
  "The water flow seems stronger/weaker"  gain constitution/gain strength
  "The sink quivers upward"               levitation
  "You smell rotten <fruit>"              poison resistance
  "Several flies buzz angrily"            protection from shape changers
  "Static electricity surrounds the sink" shock resistance
  "The water flow seems lesser/greater"   increase damage/increase accuracy
  "The cold water faucet flashes brightly" fire resistance
  "The hot water faucet flashes brightly" cold resistance
  "The sink seems to blend into the floor" stealth
  "You don't see anything happen"         invisibility (but the sink vanished!)
  "You thought your ring got lost..."     searching
  "You hear a loud grinding sound"        aggravate monster
  "The sink glows silver"                 free action
  "The water flow hits the bottom"        hunger
  "You see the ring slide right down"     slow digestion (never lost in sink)
  "The sink looks as good as new"         regeneration
  "You see a ring shining in its center"  adornment
  "The faucets flash from the water"      warning
  "The sink momentarily vanishes"         teleportation
  "The sink looks nothing like a deck"    polymorph (it briefly changes)
  "The sink starts running like crazy"    conflict
  "You hear a strange wind"              teleport control
  "The sink seemingly makes no change"    polymorph control
  "The ring is regurgitated"              protection
```

You have about a 95% chance of losing the ring each time, so only
test rings you're willing to sacrifice. The two exceptions: searching
and slow digestion rings are never lost.

#### Use-Testing (The Careful Way)

When you don't have access to a shop or a sink, you can sometimes
figure out what an item is by using it carefully. Here's the approach
for each category:

**Potions.** The safest test is to throw a potion at a monster and
observe the effect. Throwing avoids the risk of drinking something
lethal. If a potion heals the monster, it's some kind of healing
potion. If the monster speeds up, it's speed. If the monster becomes
invisible, well, you've learned something (and now have an invisible
monster to deal with).

You can also dip items into potions. Dipping a weapon into a potion
of sickness will poison it, confirming the potion's identity. Dipping
a unicorn horn into a potion of confusion, hallucination, or sickness
will turn it into water.

**Scrolls.** Reading is risky. Some scrolls (destroy armor, amnesia,
punishment) are genuinely harmful. The safest approach is to price-ID
first, then read scrolls from safe price groups. If you must test
blind: take off your armor before reading a scroll that might be
destroy armor. Read from a position where teleportation won't be
disastrous.

Confused reading produces different effects for many scrolls and is
sometimes useful. A confused scroll of remove curse, for example,
will *curse* items instead.

**Rings.** First, confirm the ring is not cursed (altar or pet test).
Then put it on. Many rings produce an immediate message or visible
effect: you start levitating, you become invisible, you feel
stronger. If nothing obvious happens, check your stats and inventory
for subtle changes (protection, searching). Take it off quickly if
you start feeling hungry faster than normal (hunger ring) or if
monsters seem to be approaching more aggressively (aggravate monster).

**Amulets.** Most amulets are safe to wear briefly. Put it on, wait
a few turns, take it off. The dangerous ones (strangulation, restful
sleep) are usually cursed, so check BUC first. An amulet of ESP
reveals itself if you go blind while wearing it (you'll see monsters
as brain-shapes). Amulet of reflection is trickier to detect, but
you'll notice it when a ray bounces off you.

**Armor.** Try it on (after checking it's not cursed). Magical armor
reveals itself immediately: speed boots make you faster, a cloak of
invisibility makes you invisible. Mundane armor is identifiable by
its appearance (the "old gloves" are leather gloves, "riding boots"
are fumble boots, and so on).

Here's a useful table of boot and helmet appearances:

```
  Appearance:          Possible identities:
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  mud boots            elven boots (stealth)
  buckled boots        kicking boots
  riding boots         fumble boots (often cursed!)
  snow boots           levitation boots (often cursed!)
  hiking boots         jumping boots
  combat boots         speed boots
  jungle boots         water walking boots

  conical hat          dunce cap OR cornuthaum
  plumed helmet        regular helmet
  etched helmet        helm of brilliance
  crested helmet       helm of opposite alignment
  visored helmet       helm of telepathy
```

#### Naming What You've Learned

As you gather clues, use the `#name` command (or `N`) to track what
you know. You can **call** an entire item class by a name you choose.
For example, if you've determined that "fizzy potions" are in the $200
price group, call them "fizzy=$200" so you don't forget. If you later
throw one at a monster and it speeds up, you can rename the class to
"speed."

This habit of annotating your discoveries is what separates adventurers
who die on level 8 from adventurers who reach the Castle. The dungeon
doesn't keep notes for you. You have to do it yourself.

#### A Practical Strategy

All of these techniques combine into a workflow. Here's what a
seasoned traveler does on a typical descent:

**At an altar** (priority one). Ferry everything you've found to the
altar. Drop each item. Sort your pack into blessed, uncursed, and
cursed piles. Wield or wear the blessed stuff. Stash or discard the
cursed stuff.

**At a shop** (priority two). Pick up and put down unidentified items
to get price quotes. Group them by price. Cross-reference with the
tables above. Suddenly half your inventory is narrowed to two or three
possibilities.

**Engrave-test your wands** as soon as you find them. It's fast, it
costs only one charge, and it immediately sorts wands into categories.
A wand that digs the floor is digging. A wand that freezes your
engraving is cold. Simple.

**Experiment cautiously** with the rest. Wear non-cursed rings one at
a time. Throw potions at monsters. Read scrolls from safe price groups
after removing your armor.

**Save your scrolls of identify** for the items that resist other
methods: amulets (all the same price), spellbooks (dangerous to
read if unknown), and the one stubborn potion in the $50 group that
you can't quite pin down.

  The Identification Flowchart:

     Found an item
          │
          ▼
     Can you reach an altar? ──yes──► Drop it. Check BUC.
          │no
          ▼
     Is your pet nearby? ──yes──► Drop it. Does pet avoid it?
          │no                         │yes: it's cursed
          ▼                           │no: it's safe (uncursed/blessed)
     Can you reach a shop? ──yes──► Check the price. Consult tables.
          │no
          ▼
     Is it a wand? ──yes──► Engrave-test it.

```

The whole system is about reducing uncertainty with the cheapest,
safest method first. Altars and shops are free. Engrave-testing costs
one charge. Use-testing costs more and carries risk. Scrolls of
identify are the expensive last resort. Work through the list in order
and you'll rarely be surprised.

### Provisions and Dining

Hunger is a clock. Every turn you spend in the dungeon costs
nutrition, and when the tank hits empty, you faint. Faint a few
times without eating and you die. Managing your food supply is not
glamorous, but it is essential.

#### How Hunger Works

Your nutrition starts at 900 and ticks down steadily. The rate
depends on what you're doing:

- **Base consumption** costs 1 point per turn (less while sleeping).
- **Regeneration** (from a ring or intrinsic) costs extra on odd turns.
- **Encumbrance** costs extra on odd turns if you're burdened or worse.
- **Rings** cause additional hunger while worn. Two rings drain faster.

When nutrition drops below certain thresholds, you get warnings:

| Nutrition | Status    | Effect                                    |
| --------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1000+     | Satiated  | Overfull. Eating more risks choking.      |
| 150-999   | Normal    | Fine.                                     |
| 50-149    | Hungry    | Warning message. Time to eat.             |
| 0-49      | Weak      | Movement slowed. Pray if possible.        |
| Below 0   | Fainting  | Collapse randomly. Eat NOW or die.        |

The practical takeaway: eat when you get the "Hungry" message. Don't
wait for "Weak." If you hit Fainting and have no food, pray to your
god (see [Divine Relations](#divine-relations)). Prayer cures hunger
if your god is willing to help.

#### What to Eat

**Food rations** provide 800 nutrition and are the staple food. They
weigh 20 and are common in shops. Stockpile these when you can.

**Lembas wafers** are better: 800 nutrition at only 5 weight, the
best ratio in the game. Elven characters find these more often.

**Corpses** are the primary food source in the early game. Most
fresh corpses provide nutrition proportional to the monster's size.
A few rules:

- Eat corpses within a few turns of the kill, or they rot and cause
  food poisoning (lethal without treatment).
- Never eat old corpses. If in doubt, don't eat it.
- Some corpses grant intrinsic resistances (poison resistance from
  killer bees, fire resistance from fire giants, etc.). Eat these
  deliberately.
- Some corpses are harmful (floating eyes paralyze you, green slimes
  turn you into slime, cockatrice corpses kill you). Know which
  corpses are safe before eating.

**Tripe rations** are terrible for you (your character retches) but
pets love them. Save tripe for your pet.

**Tins** are preserved food that never spoil. They take several
turns to open (one turn with a tin opener, three with a dagger,
more with bare hands). Blessed tins open instantly. A tin of
spinach increases your strength.

#### Dangerous Foods

- **Cockatrice corpse:** instant death by stoning. Never eat this.
- **Acidic corpses** (acid blob, etc.): damage unless acid resistant.
- **Poisonous corpses:** damage and stat drain unless poison resistant.
- **Rotten corpses:** food poisoning. Pray immediately if affected.
- **Cannibalism** (eating your own race): costs 2 to 5 luck and
  gives the aggravate monster intrinsic. Cavemen and orcs are exempt.

#### Useful Corpse Effects

| Corpse               | Effect                             |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Floating eye         | Telepathy (but paralyzes you too)  |
| Killer bee           | Poison resistance                  |
| Fire giant/ant       | Fire resistance                    |
| Winter wolf          | Cold resistance                    |
| Wraith               | Gain an experience level           |
| Giant                | Increase strength                  |
| Lizard               | Cures stoning in progress          |
| Newt                 | May restore 1 to 3 mana            |
| Stalker              | Invisibility (and see invisible)   |
| Tengu                | Teleportitis / teleport control    |
| Disenchanter         | Intrinsic protection               |

Eating for intrinsics is one of the most important things you can
do in the early and mid game. Poison resistance should be a top
priority.

#### Food Strategy

1. Eat fresh corpses as your primary food source.
2. Save food rations and lembas wafers for emergencies.
3. Eat intrinsic-granting corpses deliberately (even if not hungry).
4. Pray when Weak or Fainting if you have nothing to eat.
5. Buy food from shops when you can afford it.
6. Don't carry more food than you need. It's heavy.

### The Apothecary

Potions are common finds in the dungeon, appearing as colorful
liquids in randomized bottles. The color tells you nothing about
the contents until you've identified that color for this game. A
"smoky potion" might be healing in one game and paralysis in the
next.

#### The Potion Table

Potions are organized by price. Cross-reference any unidentified
potion's shop price with this table to narrow down what it might be:

| Price | Potions at this price                                                              |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $50   | Booze, fruit juice, see invisible, sickness                                        |
| $100  | Confusion, extra healing, hallucination, healing, restore ability, sleeping, water |
| $150  | Blindness, gain energy, invisibility, monster detection, object detection, speed   |
| $200  | Acid, gain ability, gain level, oil, polymorph                                     |
| $300  | Full healing, levitation, paralysis                                                |

Water is the oddity in the $100 group. It appears as "clear potion"
and is always identifiable on sight.

#### Key Potions

**Healing, extra healing, full healing.** The healing chain. Extra
healing is the workhorse, curing blindness and sickness in addition
to restoring hit points. Blessed extra healing and full healing also
raise your maximum HP. Stockpile these.

**Gain ability.** Raises all stats by 1 when blessed, or one random
stat when uncursed. Extremely valuable. Save these until you can
bless them.

**Speed.** Grants the speed intrinsic, which is one of the most
important buffs in the game. Quaff one blessed potion of speed and
you're faster for the rest of the game.

**Holy water.** Created by dropping uncursed water potions on a
co-aligned altar and praying. Holy water (blessed water) can bless
items you dip into it. This is the foundation of item management:
bless your scrolls of identify, your potions of gain ability, your
scrolls of enchant weapon. Stockpile holy water aggressively.

**Gain level.** Raises your experience level by one. Useful for
reaching quest eligibility. More importantly, reading a confused
scroll of teleportation while standing on the right square can
interact with this in complex ways.

#### Alchemy

Potions can be mixed by dipping one into another. Most random
combinations produce useless results (or explosions), but a few
recipes are reliable and valuable:

| Dip this            | Into this           | Result         |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | -------------- |
| Healing             | Gain energy/level   | Extra healing  |
| Extra healing       | Gain energy/level   | Full healing   |
| Full healing        | Gain energy/level   | Gain ability   |
| Fruit juice         | Gain energy/level   | See invisible  |
| Speed               | Healing             | Extra healing  |
| Speed               | Extra healing       | Levitation     |

The chain from healing up to gain ability via gain energy or gain
level is the core alchemy sequence. If you find potions of gain
energy (cheap and common), you can upgrade your healing potions into
much more valuable ones.

There is a 10% chance of explosion on any non-water mixture, so do
this in a safe place. Cursed potions always explode when used as the
dipping target.

#### Unicorn Horn Interactions

Dipping a unicorn horn into certain potions converts them:

- **Blindness, confusion, hallucination** become uncursed water.
- **Sickness** becomes fruit juice.

This is useful for cleaning up dangerous potions you've accidentally
picked up, or for generating water for holy water production.

---

### The Scroll Rack

Scrolls are single-use magical documents that produce effects when
read. They appear with random labels ("ZELGO MER," "DAIYEN FOOELS,"
and so on) that are consistent within a game but randomized between
games. Once you identify a scroll by label, you know all scrolls
with that label for the rest of the run.

#### The Scroll Table

| Price | Scrolls at this price                                                                                             |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $20   | Identify                                                                                                          |
| $50   | Light                                                                                                             |
| $60   | Blank paper, enchant weapon                                                                                       |
| $80   | Enchant armor, remove curse                                                                                       |
| $100  | Confuse monster, destroy armor, fire, food detection, gold detection, magic mapping, scare monster, teleportation |
| $200  | Amnesia, create monster, earth, taming                                                                            |
| $300  | Charging, genocide, punishment, stinking cloud                                                                    |

The $20 scroll is always identify, the most common and most useful
scroll in the game. The $60 group is very valuable (enchant weapon).
The $80 group is similarly good (enchant armor, remove curse). The
$100 group is large and mixed, containing both excellent scrolls
(magic mapping, teleportation) and dangerous ones (destroy armor).

#### Key Scrolls

**Identify.** The workhorse. Use it on items that resist other
identification methods. Blessed identify may identify multiple items
at once (with positive luck, always at least two).

**Enchant weapon and enchant armor.** These raise the enchantment of
your wielded weapon or a random piece of worn armor by +1 (uncursed)
or potentially more (blessed). Save these until you have your
endgame gear, then bless them and use them. Enchanting beyond +5
risks destroying the item, but blessed scrolls can safely push
higher.

**Remove curse.** Uncurses worn and wielded items. Blessed remove
curse uncurses everything in your main inventory. Essential if
you've accidentally put on a cursed item.

**Charging.** Recharges wands and other items. Save these for your
wand of wishing (to get an extra wish or two) or other critical
wands. Blessed charging gives more charges. Don't recharge a wand
too many times, as the explosion chance increases with each recharge.

**Genocide.** Eliminates a monster species (uncursed) or an entire
monster class (blessed) from the game permanently. Use it on
liches, mind flayers, or whatever is causing you the most trouble.
Confused reading genocides your own race, which kills you.

**Magic mapping.** Reveals the entire level layout. Blessed also
reveals secret doors. Extremely useful in Gehennom's mazes.

**Scare monster.** Don't read it. Drop it on the floor and stand
on it. It works like a permanent Elbereth, frightening most
monsters. Pick it up and it crumbles to dust (if it has ever been
dropped before).

**Teleportation.** Teleports you randomly on the level (uncursed)
or to a different level (cursed or confused). With teleport control,
you choose the destination.

#### Confused Reading

Many scrolls have different effects when read while confused. Some
useful confused readings:

- **Confused remove curse** has a 25% chance of blessing or cursing
  each uncursed item (risky but sometimes useful for creating holy
  water: confuse-read remove curse while wielding uncursed water).
- **Confused destroy armor** actually erodeproofs a piece of armor.
- **Confused enchant armor** erodeproofs a piece of armor.
- **Confused enchant weapon** erodeproofs your weapon.
- **Confused genocide** genocides your own role. Don't do this.

### Wands and Staves

Wands are reusable magical items that produce directed effects when
zapped. They come in three types: **ray wands** fire a beam in a
direction that bounces off walls, **beam wands** affect what they
hit in a straight line, and **non-directional wands** affect the
area around you.

#### The Wand Table

| Price | Wand                    | Type  | Max Charges |
| ----- | ----------------------- | ----- | ----------- |
| $100  | Light                   | NODIR | 15          |
| $100  | Nothing                 | BEAM  | 15          |
| $150  | Digging                 | RAY   | 8           |
| $150  | Enlightenment           | NODIR | 15          |
| $150  | Magic missile           | RAY   | 8           |

| $150  | Striking                | BEAM  | 8           |
| $150  | Undead turning          | BEAM  | 8           |
| $150  | Locking                 | BEAM  | 8           |
| $175  | Cold                    | RAY   | 8           |
| $175  | Fire                    | RAY   | 8           |
| $175  | Lightning               | RAY   | 8           |
| $175  | Sleep                   | RAY   | 8           |
| $200  | Cancellation            | BEAM  | 8           |
| $200  | Create monster          | NODIR | 15          |
| $200  | Polymorph               | BEAM  | 8           |
| $200  | Teleportation           | BEAM  | 8           |
| $500  | Death                   | RAY   | 8           |
| $500  | Wishing                 | NODIR | 3           |

#### Key Wands

**Wishing.** The most valuable item in the game. Each zap grants one
wish. Wands of wishing start with 1 to 3 charges and can be
recharged once (and only once) with a scroll of charging. Blessed
charging on a 0-charge wand of wishing gives 1 to 3 charges. Plan
your wishes carefully before you find one.

**Death.** Fires a death ray that instantly kills most things it
hits. Reflected by reflection. Blocked by magic resistance. One
of the best offensive tools in the late game.

**Digging.** Essential utility. Dig through walls to create
shortcuts, dig down to escape dangerous situations, dig through
rock to reach vaults and hidden areas. Every ascension kit should
include a wand of digging.

**Teleportation.** Zap monsters to send them somewhere else on the
level. Zap yourself to teleport. Enormously useful for escaping
trouble or removing a dangerous monster from your path.

**Fire, cold, lightning.** Offensive ray wands that bounce off walls.
Fire burns scrolls and spellbooks on the floor. Cold freezes water
(useful for creating paths). Lightning blinds monsters.

**Cancellation.** Removes special properties from items and monsters.
A cancelled monster loses most of its special attacks. Do NOT put
this wand in a bag of holding (it will explode the bag). Keep it
separate in your main inventory.

**Polymorph.** Transforms monsters into random other monsters and
items into random other items of the same class. Can be used
creatively (polymorph a pile of junk armor hoping for dragon scale
mail, polymorph a weak monster hoping for a useful corpse). Risky
but powerful.

#### Identification by Engraving

The engrave test (described in
[The Identification Problem](#the-identification-problem)) is the
fastest way to sort wands. Every wand type produces a distinctive
result when used to engrave on the floor.

#### Recharging

Wands can be recharged with a scroll of charging. Each recharge
increases the risk of the wand exploding. The formula is
(recharges cubed) / 343, so:

- First recharge: 0.3% explosion chance.
- Second: 2.3%.
- Third: 7.9%.
- Seventh: 100%.

Wands of wishing can only be recharged once before they explode
automatically. Use blessed charging for the best results.

#### Wresting

When a wand has 0 charges, you can still try to zap it. There is a
1/121 chance of "wresting" one final charge from the wand before it
turns to dust. This is a last resort, but it works on wands of
wishing too.

---

### Rings and Amulets

Rings are worn on your fingers (you can wear two at a time) and
provide passive effects. Amulets are worn around your neck (one at
a time). Both are randomized by appearance.

#### The Ring Table

| Price | Ring                           | Notes                          |
| ----- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| $100  | Adornment                      | +CHA, chargeable               |
| $100  | Hunger                         | Increases hunger (auto-curse)  |
| $100  | Protection                     | +AC, chargeable                |
| $100  | Protection from shape changers | Useful against werebeasts      |
| $100  | Stealth                        | Reduces noise                  |

| $100  | Warning                        | Shows nearby monsters          |
| $150  | Aggravate monster              | Bad (auto-curse)               |
| $150  | Cold resistance                | Resist cold attacks            |
| $150  | Gain constitution              | +CON, chargeable               |
| $150  | Gain strength                  | +STR, chargeable               |
| $150  | Increase accuracy              | +hit, chargeable               |
| $150  | Increase damage                | +dmg, chargeable               |
| $150  | Invisibility                   | You become invisible           |
| $150  | Poison resistance              | Immune to poison               |
| $150  | See invisible                  | See invisible creatures        |
| $150  | Shock resistance               | Resist electric attacks        |
| $200  | Fire resistance                | Resist fire attacks            |
| $200  | Free action                    | Immune to paralysis            |
| $200  | Levitation                     | Float in the air               |
| $200  | Regeneration                   | Heal faster (costs hunger)     |
| $200  | Searching                      | Auto-search each turn          |
| $200  | Slow digestion                 | Reduces hunger                 |
| $200  | Teleportation                  | Random teleports (auto-curse)  |
| $300  | Conflict                       | Monsters fight each other      |
| $300  | Polymorph                      | Random polymorphs (auto-curse) |
| $300  | Polymorph control              | Choose polymorph form          |
| $300  | Teleport control               | Choose teleport destination    |

Rings that say "auto-curse" generate cursed 90% of the time. If you
put on a ring and find you can't remove it, it's probably one of
these.

**Essential rings:** Free action (prevents paralysis, critical for
endgame), teleport control (turns random teleportation into
controlled transportation), conflict (monsters attack each other
instead of you, excellent for crowded levels), slow digestion (wear
between meals to conserve food).

**Warning:** All rings cause additional hunger while worn. Wearing
two rings drains your food supply noticeably faster. Remove rings
you don't currently need.

#### Amulets

Amulets are simpler than rings. All cost $150, so you can't price-ID
them. The key ones:

| Amulet                 | Effect                                      |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Life saving            | Revives you once from death, then crumbles  |
| Reflection             | Reflects ray attacks                        |
| Magical breathing      | Survive underwater and without air          |
| ESP                    | Detect monsters via telepathy               |
| Unchanging             | Prevents involuntary polymorph              |
| Versus poison          | Poison resistance                           |
| Strangulation          | Slowly kills you (always cursed)            |
| Restful sleep          | Puts you to sleep randomly (usually cursed) |

**Amulet of life saving** is the most important. Wear it in
dangerous situations (endgame, unfamiliar special levels). When
it triggers, you come back with full HP but the amulet is gone.

**Amulet of reflection** is excellent if you didn't get the shield
of reflection elsewhere. It frees up your shield slot.

**Amulet of magical breathing** prevents drowning, which matters
at Medusa's level and on the Plane of Water.

#### Identification

Rings and amulets are tricky to identify because many have subtle
effects. The methods from
[The Identification Problem](#the-identification-problem) apply:
sink-drop for rings, wear-test for both. Amulets all share the
same price, so shop identification doesn't help narrow them down.

---

### Tools of the Trade

Tools are a grab-bag category covering everything from pickaxes to
magic lamps. They're identified by the `(` symbol and include some
of the most useful items in the game.

#### Containers

| Container      | Weight | Special                                  |
| -------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Sack           | 15     | Basic storage                            |
| Oilskin sack   | 15     | Protects contents from water             |
| Bag of holding | 15     | Reduces weight of contents dramatically  |
| Bag of tricks  | 15     | Creates monsters when opened (not a bag) |
| Large box      | 350    | Holds 0 to 3 items, often locked         |
| Chest          | 600    | Holds 0 to 5 items, often locked         |
| Ice box        | 900    | Preserves corpses from rotting           |

A **bag of holding** is one of the most important items in the
game. Blessed, it reduces the weight of contents to roughly 1/4.
This lets you carry your entire supply of potions, scrolls, and
backup gear without being burdened. Get one from Sokoban or wish
for one.

Never put a wand of cancellation, another bag of holding, or a
charged bag of tricks inside a bag of holding. The bag will explode,
scattering your items across the floor (in current editions, items
are scattered rather than destroyed, but it's still catastrophic).

#### Unlocking Tools

A **skeleton key** is the best: 70%+ success rate on doors, 75%+
on boxes. A **lock pick** is decent. A **credit card** is worst
but still useful. Always carry one of these.

#### Light Sources

**Oil lamps** and **candles** provide light in dark areas. A
**magic lamp** is special: rubbing it has a chance of releasing a
djinni who may grant a wish (80% chance with a blessed lamp). Don't
waste your magic lamp on light. Rub it while blessed for the wish.

The **Candelabrum of Invocation** is a unique candelabra found in
Vlad's Tower. It's one of three items needed for the invocation
ritual to enter Moloch's Sanctum. You'll need seven candles to
attach to it.

#### Musical Instruments

Instruments can be played to produce various effects. A **tooled
horn** or **bugle** is needed to play the passtune at the Castle
drawbridge. A **magic harp** or **magic flute** tames or puts
monsters to sleep. A **drum of earthquake** creates pits around you.

Leather drums and wooden instruments are non-magical variants that
produce noise but no special effects.

#### Other Notable Tools

| Tool               | Use                                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Pickaxe / mattock  | Dig through walls and floors                  |
| Unicorn horn       | Cure poison, confusion, blindness, nausea     |
| Stethoscope        | Check HP and status of a monster              |
| Tin opener         | Open tins in one turn                         |
| Tinning kit        | Preserve corpses as tins                      |
| Blindfold          | Voluntarily go blind (useful for telepathy)   |
| Towel              | Wipe cream pie from face, use as blindfold    |
| Magic marker       | Write scrolls and spellbooks on blank paper   |
| Crystal ball       | Detect objects, traps, and portals on a level |
| Bell of Opening    | Invocation item (found in Vlad's Tower area)  |
| Leash              | Tie a pet to you so it follows through stairs |

A **unicorn horn** is one of the best tools in the game. Apply it
to cure confusion, blindness, sickness, hallucination, and
nausea. Always carry one.

A **magic marker** lets you write scrolls of identify, enchant
weapon, enchant armor, and other useful scrolls on blank paper.
Charges are limited, so use them wisely. Writing scrolls you've
already identified costs fewer charges.

---

### The Armory

Weapons and armor are the bread and butter of combat. Your choice
of equipment determines how hard you hit, how well you dodge, and
what special resistances you carry.

#### Armor and AC

Armor Class (AC) starts at 10 and decreases as you add protection.
Lower is better. Each point of AC reduces the chance of being hit.
At AC -10 or below, you're quite difficult to damage with physical
attacks.

The key armor slots:

| Slot   | Best mundane options                       | Best magical options                  |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Body   | Splint mail, banded mail                   | Dragon scale mail (two resistances!)  |
| Cloak  | Cloak of protection                        | Cloak of magic resistance             |
| Helmet | Helm of brilliance                         | Helm of telepathy                     |
| Gloves | Gauntlets of power                         | Gauntlets of dexterity                |
| Boots  | Speed boots                                | Water walking boots, levitation boots |
| Shield | Shield of reflection                       | Small shield (for spellcasters)       |

**Dragon scale mail** is the endgame body armor of choice. In
current editions, each color provides two extrinsic resistances.
Gray dragon scale mail provides magic resistance and is the most
popular wish target. Silver provides reflection. Black provides
disintegration resistance.

To get dragon scale mail: kill a dragon, pick up the scales it
drops, then either read a blessed scroll of enchant armor while
wearing the scales (they transform into scale mail), or wish for
the mail directly.

**Speed boots** are critical. Being faster than your enemies
means you get more turns, which means more chances to attack,
cast spells, or run away.

**Cloak of magic resistance** is one of the most important pieces
of equipment in the game, providing magic resistance in the cloak
slot and freeing up other slots for different resistances.

#### Weapons

Weapon choice depends heavily on your role and skill caps.

| Weapon         | Damage (sm/lg) | Notes                              |
| -------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Long sword     | d8 / d12       | Lawfuls can dip for Excalibur      |
| Katana         | d10 / d12      | Best base damage for a one-hander  |
| Silver saber   | d8 / d8        | +d20 vs silver-hating monsters     |
| Crysknife      | d10 / d10      | Excellent damage, fragile          |
| Tsurugi        | d16 / d8+2d6   | Two-handed, bisects small monsters |
| Runesword      | d4 / d6+d4     | Chaotic weapon                     |
| Battle-axe     | d8+d4 / d6+2d4 | Two-handed, good damage            |
| Rubber hose    | d4 / d3        | No, seriously, don't use this      |

**Excalibur** (long sword dipped in a fountain while Lawful) is one
of the best weapons: +d5 to hit and damage, level drain resistance,
automatic searching. For Lawful characters, getting Excalibur early
is a priority.

**Silver saber** deserves special mention. Many endgame threats
(demons, undead, werecreatures) are vulnerable to silver. A silver
saber does an extra d20 damage against them, making it one of the
best late-game weapons.

**Your quest artifact** is often your primary weapon or at least
worth carrying for its properties. Check what your role's artifact
does.

#### Enchantment

Weapons and armor can be enchanted using scrolls of enchant weapon
and enchant armor. Each scroll adds +1 (uncursed) or potentially
more (blessed). Enchanting beyond +5 risks destroying the item,
though blessed scrolls reduce this risk. The absolute safe limit
for enchanting is +5 for weapons and +3 for armor (with uncursed
scrolls). Blessed scrolls can push higher safely.

#### Erosion and Proofing

Weapons and armor can be damaged by rust (iron items), fire
(organic items), and corrosion (copper items). A badly damaged
item provides less AC or damage.

To fix erosion, read a confused scroll of enchant weapon (for your
weapon) or confused scroll of enchant armor (for a random worn armor
piece). This erodeproofs the item permanently without changing its
enchantment. It also repairs any existing damage.

---

### Artifacts

Artifacts are unique named items with special powers. Each artifact
can only exist once per game. They're obtained through several
means:

- **Fountain dipping** (Excalibur, for Lawful characters).
- **Sacrifice** on an altar (your god may gift you an aligned artifact).
- **Quest completion** (each role's unique quest artifact).
- **Wishing** (you can wish for most artifacts, but they resist
  if they don't match your alignment).
- **Random generation** (rare, but weapons have a small chance of
  being generated as an artifact).

#### Alignment and Blasting

Each artifact has an alignment. If you try to handle an artifact
that doesn't match your alignment:

- **Intelligent artifacts** (most quest artifacts): 8d6 damage and
  you drop the item. You cannot wield these.
- **Other misaligned artifacts**: 4d4 damage on first touch, 1/4
  chance of being blasted each subsequent touch.

#### Key Artifacts

**Excalibur** (Lawful, long sword): +d5 to hit and damage, level
drain resistance, automatic searching. The go-to weapon for Lawful
characters.

**Grayswandir** (Lawful, silver saber): +d5 to hit and damage,
double damage dealt, halved physical damage received. One of the
best weapons in the game. Wishable.

**Mjollnir** (Neutral, war hammer): Can be thrown and returns like
a boomerang (if STR 25). +d5 to hit and +d24 damage against non-
shock-resistant targets. Requires high strength to use effectively.

**Magicbane** (Neutral, athame): +d3 to hit and damage, protects
against curses while carried, cancels monsters on hit. Useful as
a secondary weapon. Can be obtained by sacrifice.

**Stormbringer** (Chaotic, runesword): +d5 to hit and damage,
drains one level from hit targets (you gain it). Attacks peaceful
monsters automatically, which can cause alignment problems.

**The Eyes of the Overworld** (Neutral, lenses): Magic resistance,
astral vision. A quest artifact for Monks.

**Quest artifacts** vary wildly by role but most provide magic
resistance, which makes them essential to carry even if you don't
wield them. Check your specific role's artifact.

## Part Five: The Craft of Adventuring

> Bush's spellbook reading tables, and the Hugo/O'Donnell files on
> gods, combat, gems, and luck mechanics, all updated for the

### Divine Relations

Your relationship with your god is one of the most important
mechanics in the game. A happy god answers prayers, forgives
transgressions, and occasionally sends gift artifacts. An angry god
smites you.

#### Prayer

Praying (`#pray`) calls on your god for help. If your god is
pleased with you and enough time has passed since your last prayer,
good things happen:

- If you're about to die (low HP, starvation, stoning, illness),
  your god fixes the problem.
- Your god may fix other afflictions (blindness, confusion,
  punishment).
- Your alignment record improves.

If your god is displeased, or you pray too soon after a previous
prayer, bad things happen instead: lightning strikes, loss of luck,
or worse.

**Prayer timeout:** After a successful prayer, you must wait
roughly 300 to 600 turns before praying again. In Gehennom, prayers
to non-Moloch gods don't work at all (your god can't hear you
there). This makes Gehennom significantly more dangerous.

**When to pray:** When you're about to die and have no other
option. Starvation (Weak or Fainting), lethal stoning in progress,
food poisoning, and critically low HP are all valid reasons. Don't
waste prayers on minor inconveniences.

#### Sacrifice

Offering fresh monster corpses at an altar builds favor with your
god. The rules:

- The corpse must be fresh (killed within the last few turns).
- Bigger monsters are more valuable sacrifices.
- The altar must match your alignment, or you're praying to someone
  else's god (which has its own consequences).
- Same-race sacrifice is forbidden and severely punished (with one
  exception: it can convert an altar to your alignment).

With enough sacrifice credit, your god may gift you an artifact
weapon. The first gift comes after relatively modest sacrifice;
subsequent gifts require substantially more. Gift artifacts are
always aligned to your god and always match a weapon skill you can
use.

#### Altars and Alignment

You can convert an altar by sacrificing on a cross-aligned altar
repeatedly. This is risky (the altar's god will be angry) but
useful if the only altar you've found doesn't match your alignment.
Having a co-aligned altar is essential for sacrifice, holy water
production, and BUC testing.

#### Crowning

If your alignment record is very high (through sacrifice and good
behavior), your god may crown you. Crowning grants a special title,
an artifact weapon (if one is available), and some intrinsics.
However, crowning also locks your alignment (you can never change
it) and raises the prayer timeout significantly. Many experienced
players avoid being crowned because the increased timeout is a
steep price.

---

### The Art of Combat

Combat in the Mazes is more nuanced than "hit monster until it
dies." Understanding the underlying mechanics helps you pick the
right fights and avoid the wrong ones.

#### To-Hit Calculation

Whether you hit a monster depends on a d20 roll modified by:

- Your experience level
- Your weapon's enchantment
- Your Luck (up to +5 or -5)
- Your Strength bonus
- The monster's AC

You need to roll at or above (10 + defender's AC - your modifiers).
Since monster AC can be very low (negative numbers), high-level
monsters can be hard to hit even with good equipment.

#### Damage

Base damage depends on your weapon and whether the target is small
or large (most weapons do different damage against each). Added to
base damage:

- Weapon enchantment (+1 per point)
- Strength bonus (up to +6 for STR 18/xx, or more)
- Weapon skill bonus (depends on skill level)
- Special bonuses (silver damage, artifact bonuses, etc.)

#### AC and Defense

Your AC determines how likely monsters are to hit you. Typical AC
values for equipped characters:

| Stage         | Typical AC | Protection level        |
| ------------- | ---------- | ----------------------- |
| Starting out  | 8 to 10    | Nearly no protection    |
| Early dungeon | 2 to 5     | Basic armor equipped    |
| Mid-game      | -5 to 0    | Enchanted armor + cloak |
| Endgame       | -20 to -10 | Full kit, enchanted     |

At AC -20, almost nothing hits you with physical attacks. But many
late-game threats use special attacks (breath weapons, spells, gaze
attacks) that ignore AC entirely. AC is necessary but not
sufficient.

#### Two-Weapon Combat

Some roles can fight with a weapon in each hand. This gives more
attacks per turn but splits your skill and enchantment bonuses.
Two-weapon combat is powerful for roles with high skill caps in it
(Rangers, Barbarians) but mediocre for others.

#### Fighting Smart

- **Use corridors.** Monsters can only approach one at a time in a
  corridor. Never fight multiple monsters in an open room if you can
  retreat to a chokepoint.
- **Fight at range.** Wands, thrown weapons, and spells let you
  damage monsters before they reach you. This is especially
  important against monsters with dangerous melee attacks.
- **Know when to run.** If a fight is going badly, use a scroll
  of teleportation, a wand of teleportation, or just run. Dead
  adventurers don't get second chances (unless wearing an amulet
  of life saving).
- **Use conflict.** A ring of conflict makes monsters fight each
  other. Walk into a room full of enemies, put on the ring, and
  watch them destroy each other while you stand in the doorway.
- **Elbereth for emergencies.** Write it, stand on it, recover.

---

### Wishes and Wishing

Wishes are the most powerful mechanic in the game. A well-timed
wish for the right item can turn a struggling run into a winning
one. But wishes are rare and can't be wasted.

#### Sources of Wishes

- **Wand of wishing:** 1 to 3 charges, found in the Castle
  treasure room. Rechargeable once.
- **Magic lamp:** Rub a blessed lamp for an 80% chance of a wish.
- **Fountain:** ~1 in 30 chance of a wish per quaff. Unreliable.
- **Throne:** Very rare chance of a wish when sitting.
- **Djinni from smoky potion:** Rare (1 in 13 base probability),
  and even then only 20% wish chance (80% if blessed).

Most games give you 3 to 5 wishes total, primarily from the Castle
wand and a magic lamp. Plan ahead.

#### What to Wish For

The conventional wisdom for wish priority:

1. **Gray dragon scale mail** (magic resistance + AC, if you don't
   have magic resistance yet).
2. **Silver dragon scale mail** (reflection + AC, if you don't have
   reflection yet).
3. **Speed boots** (if you don't have speed).
4. **Gauntlets of power** (STR 25, +AC, if your role benefits).
5. **Amulet of life saving** (insurance for the endgame).
6. **A specific artifact** (Grayswandir is a common wish target).

Don't wish for consumables (scrolls, potions) unless you
desperately need a specific one. Items you can find or create
through normal play aren't worth a wish.

#### Wish Syntax

When the game asks "For what do you wish?", be specific:

- "blessed +3 gray dragon scale mail" gets you exactly that.
- Just "gray dragon scale mail" gives you an uncursed +0 version.
- You cannot wish for artifacts that are already generated.
- You cannot wish for the Amulet of Yendor (nice try).

---

### Spellcasting

Spells are reusable abilities learned from spellbooks. Unlike
scrolls (which are consumed on use) or wands (which have limited
charges), spells can be cast repeatedly as long as you have mana
(Pw, power) and the spell hasn't expired from memory.

#### Learning Spells

Read a spellbook to learn the spell it contains. Reading takes
several turns and can fail:

- Higher-level spells are harder to learn.
- Intelligence and role affect success rate.
- Cursed spellbooks may paralyze you or summon monsters.
- Blessed spellbooks are easier to learn from.
- Each spell stays in memory for ~20,000 turns, then must be
  relearned.

Wizards are the best spellcasters: they learn faster, fail less,
and have the widest range of useful spells. Other roles can cast
some spells but with less efficiency.

#### Key Spells

| Spell           | Level | Effect                                  |
| --------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------- |
| Force bolt      | 1     | Ranged attack (d6 to 4d6 by skill)      |
| Healing         | 1     | Restore hit points                      |
| Identify        | 3     | Identify items (saves scrolls)          |
| Magic mapping   | 5     | Reveal the level (saves scrolls)        |
| Finger of death | 7     | Kill one monster (resisted by MR)       |
| Charm monster   | 3     | Tame an adjacent creature               |
| Detect monsters | 1     | Sense nearby monsters                   |
| Remove curse    | 3     | Uncurse worn/wielded items              |

For Wizards, learning **identify** and **magic mapping** as spells
dramatically reduces your need for scrolls of those types.
**Finger of death** is the ultimate offensive spell. **Charm
monster** gives you powerful allies.

#### Mana Management

Your power (Pw) pool determines how many spells you can cast before
resting. Power regenerates over time (faster with higher Wisdom and
with a regeneration source). The Energy Vortex trick: allow an
energy vortex to hit you while carrying an amulet of reflection, and
it will increase your maximum power.

High-level spells cost significant power. You can't spam finger of
death unless you have a very large power pool. Plan your casting
and carry backup options (wands, scrolls) for when your mana runs
low.

---

### Curses and How to Break Them

Cursed items are items that have been touched by malign influence.
They cling to you, malfunction, or actively harm you.

#### How Items Get Cursed

- Generated cursed (some item types, like rings of teleportation,
  are almost always cursed).
- Stepping on a cursed item in a bones level (80% curse chance on
  bones items).
- A monster cursing your inventory.
- Reading a confused scroll of remove curse.
- Contact with unholy water.

#### Effects of Cursed Items

- **Cursed worn armor and rings** can't be removed. You're stuck
  with them until the curse is lifted.
- **Cursed weapons** can't be unwielded.
- **Cursed potions** may have reversed or worsened effects.
- **Cursed scrolls** often do the opposite of what you want.
- **Cursed tools** malfunction. A cursed bag of holding doubles the
  weight of its contents instead of reducing it.
- **Cursed food** doesn't taste great but isn't usually lethal.

#### Detecting Curses

- **Altar test.** Drop an item on an altar. Black flash means
  cursed.
- **Pet test.** Your pet refuses to step on cursed items.
- **Priest test.** A temple priest will identify BUC status for a
  fee.
- **Scroll of identify.** Always reveals the full status.

#### Removing Curses

- **Scroll of remove curse.** Uncursed version uncurses worn and
  wielded items. Blessed version uncurses everything in your
  inventory.
- **Holy water.** Dip a cursed item in holy water: it becomes
  uncursed.
- **Prayer.** A pleased god will uncurse your worn items as part of
  answering a prayer (though praying just to uncurse items is
  wasteful).

Always carry holy water and a scroll of remove curse for
emergencies. Getting stuck with a cursed ring of teleportation or
cursed levitation boots is a common way runs go sideways.

---

### Luck and Fortune

Luck is a hidden number that affects nearly everything you do.
Combat, prayer, wishes, item generation, scroll effects, and more
are all influenced by your Luck value. Understanding how it works
and how to maintain it is important.

#### How Luck Works

Luck ranges from -13 to +13. It starts at 0 and drifts back toward
0 over time. Positive luck makes good outcomes more likely; negative
luck makes bad outcomes more likely.

**Luck timeout.** Every 600 turns, your luck moves one point toward
0. If you have +5 luck, it will drop to +4 after 600 turns, then
+3 after 1200 turns, and so on, eventually reaching 0.

**Luckstone.** Carrying a luckstone in your open inventory
(not inside a container) prevents luck from timing out. Your luck
stays wherever it is until something changes it. This is why getting
the luckstone from Mine's End is so important.

#### Gaining and Losing Luck

| Action                                   | Luck change |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Sacrificing on your own altar            | +1          |
| Identifying gems for a shopkeeper        | +1          |
| Sitting on a throne (lucky outcome)      | +1          |
| Going down stairs in Sokoban             | -1          |
| Breaking Sokoban rules (scroll of earth) | -1          |
| Killing a peaceful creature              | -1 to -5    |
| Attacking your pet                       | -1          |
| Cannibalism                              | -2 to -5    |

Many other actions affect luck. The general pattern: virtuous
actions raise it, destructive or dishonest actions lower it.

#### Why Luck Matters

At Luck +5 (or higher, with a luckstone):

- You hit more often in combat.
- Your prayers are more likely to be answered.
- Scrolls of enchant weapon/armor are more effective.
- Wands of wishing are more likely to work perfectly.
- Fountain wishes become slightly more likely.

At negative luck, all of these go wrong. Some effects are
catastrophic: at Luck -10 or worse, prayer always fails and many
items don't work as intended.

The practical advice: get a luckstone early, sacrifice occasionally
to keep luck positive, and don't kill peacefuls.

## Part Six: The Deep Dungeon

---

### The Castle

We covered the Castle's location and how to enter it in
[Branches and Landmarks](#branches-and-landmarks). Here's what to
do once you're inside.

The Castle contains:

- A **throne room** with a throne and guards. Sitting on the throne
  is tempting but risky (see
  [Points of Interest](#points-of-interest)).
- **Barracks** with soldiers carrying decent equipment.
- **Four outer rooms** along the north and south walls. One contains
  the **wand of wishing** in a chest. Search them all.
- A **maze section** with a minotaur guarding it. The minotaur hits
  hard but isn't especially resistant to magic.

Strategy: clear the Castle carefully. Use a ring of conflict to turn
the guards against each other. Loot everything. Use your wand of
wishing to fill critical gaps in your equipment (gray dragon scale
mail, silver dragon scale mail, gauntlets of power, speed boots,
whatever you're missing).

Once you're fully equipped, the staircase down leads to Gehennom.
Take a moment before descending. Make sure you have:

- Magic resistance
- Reflection
- Fire resistance
- Poison resistance
- A wand of digging
- A unicorn horn
- Plenty of food
- Holy water
- Scrolls of teleportation and identify
- Your quest artifact

If you're missing any of these, go back up and find them.

---

### Gehennom

Gehennom is the second half of the dungeon, and it's a different
experience from everything above. The levels are mazes, the monsters
are demons, and your god can't hear your prayers here.

Consider this your travel advisory: Gehennom is hostile territory
from the moment you arrive.

#### What's Different

- **No prayer.** Your god cannot hear you in Gehennom (unless you
  worship Moloch). This means no emergency healing, no food rescue,
  no curse removal via prayer. You are on your own.
- **Fire everywhere.** Fire traps are common. Many monsters breathe
  fire. Make sure you have fire resistance.
- **Demon lords.** Named demon lords (Orcus, Baalzebub, Asmodeus,
  Juiblex, Yeenoghu, Demogorgon) appear on specific levels. Each is
  a major fight. Some can summon other demons.
- **Teleportation restrictions.** You can't teleport on most
  Gehennom levels. This limits your escape options.
- **Mazes.** Most Gehennom levels are mazes rather than rooms and
  corridors. A wand of digging or pickaxe is essential for cutting
  through walls.

#### Key Objectives in Gehennom

1. **Vlad's Tower.** A three-level tower within Gehennom. Vlad the
   Impaler (a vampire lord) sits at the top, guarding the
   Candelabrum of Invocation. Kill Vlad, take the Candelabrum.

2. **The Wizard's Tower.** The Wizard of Yendor is here, along with
   the Book of the Dead. The Wizard is extremely dangerous: he can
   teleport, summon monsters, steal the Amulet, and harass you for
   the rest of the game after you disturb him. Kill him, take the
   Book of the Dead.

3. **The vibrating square.** Somewhere on the level directly above
   Moloch's Sanctum, there is a square that vibrates when you stand
   on it. This is where you perform the Invocation ritual.

4. **The Invocation.** At the vibrating square, with the
   Candelabrum lit (7 candles attached), the Bell of Opening rung,
   and the Book of the Dead read, you open the passage to Moloch's
   Sanctum.

5. **Moloch's Sanctum.** The high priest of Moloch guards the
   Amulet of Yendor. Defeat him and take the Amulet. Then turn
   around and climb all the way back up through the entire dungeon.

#### Survival Tips

- Carry extra food. You can't pray for it.
- Carry scrolls of remove curse. You can't pray curses away.
- Dig through maze walls instead of navigating them.
- Kill the Wizard fast. Once disturbed, he teleports to you
  periodically to harass you, steal items, and curse your gear. The
  sooner you end him (temporarily, he comes back), the fewer
  interruptions you'll face.
- Level teleportation out of Gehennom doesn't work while you carry
  the Amulet. You must walk all the way up.

---

### The Ascension Run

After taking the Amulet of Yendor from Moloch's Sanctum, you need
to carry it from the bottom of Gehennom all the way back to the
surface and through the Elemental Planes. This is the Ascension Run,
and it's where many otherwise successful games end.

#### The Problems

- **The Wizard of Yendor** periodically teleports to you, summoning
  nasty monsters and trying to steal the Amulet. He will not stop.
  Kill him each time; he always comes back.
- **The Amulet blocks teleportation.** You can't level teleport
  while carrying the Amulet. You must climb every staircase from
  Gehennom to the surface.
- **Covetous monsters.** Demon lords and the Wizard can warp to
  your position and attack. They specifically target you for the
  Amulet.
- **The Mysterious Force.** While carrying the Amulet in Gehennom,
  each time you climb stairs, there's a chance you'll be teleported
  to a random location on the level instead of going up. This
  doesn't apply once you're above Gehennom.

#### Strategy

Speed is the priority. Don't fight everything. Don't explore. Don't
loot. Just go up.

- Use your wand of digging to reach staircases quickly.
- Zap problem monsters with teleportation or death wands.
- If the Wizard shows up, kill him fast or teleport him away.
- Use scrolls of teleportation on yourself to reach stairs faster
  (on levels where teleport works).
- Elbereth is useful when you need a turn to recover.

Once you reach the top of the Dungeons of Doom, the final staircase
leads to the Elemental Planes.

---

### The Elemental Planes

The Elemental Planes are the final gauntlet: four special levels
between you and the Astral Plane. Each has a magic portal to the
next plane, and you must reach it to progress.

#### Plane of Earth

A level packed with boulders and earth elementals. The portal is
hidden somewhere in the level. Use a wand of digging to tunnel
through boulders and walls. A crystal ball or scroll of magic
mapping will reveal the portal's location. Move fast; the level
is claustrophobic and elementals hit hard.

#### Plane of Air

An open expanse with no walls, just air. Air elementals are
extremely fast and attack multiple times per turn. They cannot be
genocided. A ring of conflict helps immensely (let them fight each
other). A scroll of magic mapping reveals the portal. Being
engulfed by a vortex can paradoxically help: the vortex carries you
around the level, and if it happens to cross the portal, you're
through.

#### Plane of Fire

Fire everywhere. Everything is on fire. Fire resistance is
mandatory. Fire elementals and other fire creatures fill the level.
The portal is hidden among the flames. Map the level, find the
portal, reach it.

#### Plane of Water

Underwater. You need magical breathing (from an amulet or intrinsic)
to survive here. The level is a series of water-filled chambers with
occasional air pockets. Sea monsters will try to drown you. Find
the portal and get through. This is the last obstacle before the
Astral Plane.

#### The Astral Plane

The final level. Three altars line the central temple: one Lawful,
one Neutral, one Chaotic. You must sacrifice the Amulet of Yendor
on the altar matching your alignment to ascend and win the game.

The Astral Plane is swarming with Angels, the three Riders (Death,
Famine, Pestilence), and other powerful enemies. The Riders cannot
be permanently killed. Your goal is not to fight everything but to
reach the correct altar.

- Use a wand of teleportation or conflict to clear a path.
- The Riders will follow you. Don't engage unless you have to.
- If you sacrifice on the wrong altar, you'll lose the Amulet and
  need to retrieve it.
- Once you sacrifice on the correct altar: you ascend. You win.
  Congratulations.

### Sokoban Solutions

> *Boudewijn Waijers mapped solutions for all eight Sokoban level
> variants in 2001. The puzzles haven't changed. His solutions
> still work.*

Sokoban is a fixed set of four puzzle floors, each with two
possible layouts (A and B, randomly chosen). You push boulders onto
holes to fill them, or onto traps to block them, clearing a path
to the stairs up. You cannot pull boulders, so every push is
permanent. One wrong move can make the level unsolvable.

The prize at the top is either a **bag of holding** (variant A)
or an **amulet of reflection** (variant B).

A few universal rules:

- **No teleportation** works in Sokoban. No digging either.
- Going back downstairs costs **-1 Luck each time**. Solve each
  floor in one visit.
- Using a scroll of earth in Sokoban also costs **-1 Luck**.
- After solving a level, push leftover boulders into corners so
  they don't block your path if you pass through again.

The eight level maps and their solutions are too large to reproduce
in full here, but the general approach for each floor:

1. **Identify which variant you have** by comparing the layout to
   known maps. The two variants for each floor are visually
   distinct.
2. **Work from the holes outward.** Figure out which boulder needs
   to end up in each hole, then trace backward to find the push
   sequence.
3. **Don't push boulders against walls** unless that's their final
   position. A boulder flush against a wall can only be pushed
   along the wall, never away from it.
4. **Clear the easy boulders first.** Some boulders only need one
   or two pushes. Get those into position before tackling the
   complex sequences.

The solutions are deterministic: for each variant, there is a known
sequence of pushes that works every time. Experienced players
memorize them. If you prefer to solve the puzzles yourself, the
above tips are enough to get started. If you get stuck, the
community has published step-by-step solutions for every variant.

### Voluntary Challenges

> *Dion Nicolaas cataloged the voluntary challenge conducts for
> RGRN, with contributions from Kate Nepveu, Raisse, Wim Benthem,
> Stephen Churchill, nyra, and Dylan O'Donnell.*

Once you've ascended a few times, you may find yourself looking
for a harder challenge. NetHack tracks a set of **conducts**:
voluntary restrictions that you can impose on yourself. At the end
of a game, the final score screen lists which conducts you
maintained. Nobody forces you to follow any of them. That's what
makes them interesting.

| Conduct         | Restriction                                        |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Foodless        | Never eat anything at all                          |
| Vegan           | Eat only vegan-safe food (no animal products)      |
| Vegetarian      | Eat only vegetarian food (no meat corpses)         |
| Atheist         | Never pray, sacrifice, or use altars               |
| Weaponless      | Never hit a monster with a wielded weapon          |
| Pacifist        | Never directly kill a monster                      |
| Illiterate      | Never read anything (scrolls, spellbooks, signs)   |
| Genocideless    | Never genocide a monster species                   |
| Polypileless    | Never polymorph objects                            |
| Polyselfless    | Never polymorph yourself                           |
| Wishless        | Never make a wish                                  |
| Artiwishless    | Never wish for an artifact                         |

Some of these are straightforward variations on normal play
(genocideless, artiwishless). Others fundamentally change how you
approach the game:

**Foodless** is brutal. You can't eat, so you must survive entirely
on prayer, rings of slow digestion, and careful nutrition
management through other means. Every turn counts.

**Atheist** removes prayer as a safety net. No emergency healing,
no hunger rescue, no altar-based identification. You're on your
own with what the dungeon gives you.

**Pacifist** means you can't kill anything directly. Your pet can
kill for you. Traps can kill for you. Boulders, conflict, and
creative use of the environment can kill for you. But you
personally cannot deal the killing blow. This turns the game into
a puzzle of indirect violence.

**Illiterate** is one of the hardest. No scrolls, no spellbooks,
no engraving Elbereth (it contains letters). This eliminates most
of the identification system, all scroll effects, and all spells.

Conducts can be combined. A vegan atheist pacifist ascension is
possible. It has been done. Some players have ascended with all
conducts simultaneously, which requires extraordinary knowledge of
the game's edge cases and a great deal of patience.

The conduct system is one of NetHack's best features: it turns a
single game into dozens of different games, each with its own
constraints and discoveries.

### Shopping and Shopkeeper Pricing

> *Gregory Bond's shopping guide (2001) was the first to document
> the deterministic pricing formulas that shopkeepers use. The
> price identification technique described here is based on his
> work.*

Shopkeepers are your primary source of gold-for-goods exchange, and
also one of your best tools for identification. Their pricing is
not random. It follows a formula, and if you understand the formula,
you can figure out what an item is just by asking how much it costs.

#### How Prices Work

Every item has a **base price** set by its type. When a shopkeeper
quotes you a price, the base price has been modified by several
factors:

- **Charisma.** High charisma gets discounts (up to 50% off at
  CHA 19+). Low charisma gets markups (up to double at CHA 5 or
  below).
- **Unidentified markup.** If you haven't identified the item, 1
  in 4 chance of a 33% markup on the buy price.
- **Tourist tax.** Tourists (or anyone wearing a Hawaiian shirt)
  pay 33% more.
- **Anger surcharge.** An angry shopkeeper charges 33% more.
- **Enchantment.** Weapons and armor gain 10gp per point of
  positive enchantment.

#### Using Prices for Identification

The key insight: even with the charisma modifier and random markup,
you can often figure out the base price of an item by picking it
up in a shop and noting the quoted price. Divide by your charisma
modifier, account for the possible 33% markup, and you'll land on
a base price that narrows the item to one or two possibilities.

This is especially useful for:

- **Scrolls.** Identify scrolls ($20) are the only scrolls at
  their price point. Any scroll quoted cheaply in a shop is almost
  certainly identify.
- **Potions.** The $50, $100, $150, $200, and $300 groups each
  contain a manageable number of potions. A price check splits
  a pile of unknown potions into small groups.
- **Rings.** The $100, $150, $200, and $300 groups are useful for
  narrowing rings.
- **Wands.** The $100, $150, $175, $200, and $500 groups work well.
  A $500 wand is either death or wishing.

#### Selling and Credit

When you sell items, you get roughly half the base price (1/3 for
Tourists). Unidentified items may lose an additional 25%. The sell
price is less useful for identification than the buy price, but
it's still a data point.

Shopkeepers extend credit. If you drop gold in a shop, it becomes
credit. If you can't afford an item, some shopkeepers will let you
take it on credit (you'll owe them). Leaving the shop without
paying is theft, and the shopkeeper will attack.

#### Stealing

The most common method of acquiring expensive items for free is
**pet theft.** If your pet picks up an item from the shop floor
and carries it outside the shop doorway, you haven't stolen it.
The pet did. The shopkeeper doesn't blame you. This takes patience
(the pet has to wander onto the item, then wander out the door)
but it costs nothing and angers nobody.

Other methods: teleporting out with merchandise, digging through
the floor, or using a scroll of teleportation on the shopkeeper
himself. These are all technically theft and will make the
shopkeeper hostile. Pacifying an angry shopkeeper requires paying
for everything you took.

### What Changed Since Last Time

If you're an experienced traveler returning after some time away, the
current edition of the Mazes includes several notable changes from the
version you may remember. The most significant:

- **Themed rooms** are now a regular feature of dungeon generation.
  You'll encounter rooms with specific monster or item themes that
  didn't exist before.
- **Four new monster species**: the displacer beast, genetic
  engineer, gold dragon, and baby gold dragon now roam the Mazes.
- **The helm of caution** is a new piece of armor.
- **Mind flayers** no longer cause amnesia (they still drain
  Intelligence, which can still kill you).
- **Unicorn horns** no longer restore lost attributes. This is a
  major change. In previous editions, the unicorn horn was a
  cure-all; now you'll need other solutions.
- **Dragon scale mail** now provides two extrinsic resistances
  instead of one. This makes it even more desirable.
- **Bags of holding** no longer destroy their contents on explosion.
  Items are scattered on the floor instead, which is bad but not
  catastrophic.
- **Sacrifice** for artifact generation now requires a minimum
  sacrifice value.
- **Gehennom** levels are more varied and interesting.
- **Special levels** can now generate mirrored (flipped), so don't
  rely on fixed maps.
- **Monsters** can now use containers and unlock chests.

### Acknowledgements

NetHack has been played, cursed at, loved, and documented since
1987. The game itself is the work of the NetHack DevTeam, a
loose collective of developers who have maintained one of the
longest-running open source projects in existence. But the
documentation, the strategy, the collected wisdom about how to
actually survive the thing, that came from the players.

In the early days, knowledge spread through Usenet, specifically
the newsgroup **rec.games.roguelike.nethack** (RGRN). Thousands
of players posted questions, argued about strategy, and slowly
assembled a shared body of knowledge about a game that refused to
explain itself. This was before wikis, before Reddit, before
Discord. If you wanted to know whether a cockatrice corpse could
be wielded as a weapon, you searched the RGRN archives and hoped
someone had asked before you. Someone usually had.

Out of those conversations came the first spoiler files: plain text
documents that attempted to catalog every item, every monster, every
interaction. They were written by hand, cross-referenced against the
source code, and shared freely. They represented hundreds of hours
of work by people who simply loved the game and wanted to help
others play it.

This guide stands on their work. Specifically:

**Kevin Hugo** compiled the first comprehensive spoiler set for
NetHack 3.2.2, covering every item class, monster stat, spell
formula, and score calculation in methodical detail. **Dylan
O'Donnell** updated the entire set for 3.4.3, correcting, expanding,
and maintaining the files over several years. Together, the
Hugo/O'Donnell spoilers became the definitive reference: 38 files
covering potions, scrolls, wands, rings, amulets, tools, weapons,
armor, artifacts, food, monsters, spells, and more. The item data
tables throughout Parts Four and Five of this guide are verified
against their work. Published under BSD-like terms.

**Paul Waterman** wrote the WCST NetHack Spoilers (originally the
"World's Encyclopaedia of NetHack"), a single sprawling document
that covered the entire game in a conversational, opinionated voice.
Where the Hugo/O'Donnell files were reference manuals, the WCST was
a travel guide. It told you not just what things did but what to do
about them. It was the original inspiration for the tone and
structure of this guide, though no text has been copied from it.
Published under CC-BY-NC-ND.

**Kate Nepveu** maintained steelypips.org, the web archive that
preserved the Hugo/O'Donnell spoilers, the RGRN community articles,
and her own excellent guides (including the Elbereth FAQ cited in
our traps chapter). Without Kate's patient archival work, much of
this material might have disappeared when Usenet faded.

The following **RGRN community authors** contributed articles,
FAQs, and guides that informed specific sections of this guide:

- **David Damerell** wrote the Object Identification FAQ, the
  original systematic guide to figuring out what you've found
  without wasting scrolls of identify.
- **Kieron Dunbar** wrote the wand identification guide, laying
  out the engrave-test method that remains the fastest way to sort
  wands.
- **Trevor Powell** compiled the Instadeath Spoiler, the definitive
  catalog of ways to die in a single turn, cited in our Dangerous
  Encounters chapter.
- **Arien Malec** wrote the Medusa guide, collecting crossing
  strategies from dozens of RGRN posters and organizing them into
  a clear checklist.
- **Matthew Lahut** wrote the prayer guide that untangled the
  timeout and alignment systems.
- **Boudewijn Waijers** mapped solutions for all eight Sokoban
  level variants.
- **Steven Bush** calculated spellbook reading success rates.
- **Gregory Bond** documented shopkeeper pricing formulas.
- **Dion Nicolaas** cataloged the voluntary challenge conducts.
- **David Goldfarb** wrote the air elemental FAQ.
- **Hojita Discordia** documented experience value calculations.

And many others: Ray Chason, Pat Rankin, Geoduck, Topi Linkala,
Geoffrey Eadon, Roger Broadbent, Sebastian Haas, Jukka Lahtinen,
and the countless anonymous posters on RGRN who asked "has anyone
tried..." and then reported back.

This is what a community looks like over decades. People writing
things down so that others don't have to die the same stupid death.
It's generous, it's nerdy, and it's one of the best things about
games.

All data in this guide has been verified against the current game
source code. Any errors are ours alone.
