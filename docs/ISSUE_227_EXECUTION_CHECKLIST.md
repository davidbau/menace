# Issue #227 Execution Checklist

Issue: https://github.com/davidbau/menace/issues/227

This file is the single execution checklist for #227.
If any other doc conflicts, follow this file.

## Design Principle

Cyclic imports between JS modules are fine — ESM resolves function bindings
lazily at call time. The only real constraint is: **no cycles in init-time
constant computation**. A module's top-level code must not read an exported
constant from another module that hasn't finished evaluating yet.

Solution: all exported capitalized constants live in a small set of **leaf
header files** (`const.js`, `objects.js`, `monsters.js`, `artifacts.js`,
`version.js`, `storage.js`, data files). These files import only from each
other and never from gameplay modules, so they always finish evaluating first.
Everything else can freely import from them and from each other.

## Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- No `initAll` and no global startup orchestrator.
- Structure-only in Phase 1 (no gameplay behavior changes).
- Keep parity no worse than baseline after each batch.
- Land small commits with validation evidence.
- When moving constants into `const.js`, annotate provenance with original
  NetHack C source/header context (for example `include/rm.h`, `include/sym.h`,
  `src/drawing.c`).

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Laydown (Structure-Only)

### 1A. Ownership / boundaries
- [x] Retire `map.js` ownership; move canonical map/room structures to owning modules (`game.js`, `mkroom.js`).
- [x] Consolidate constant entrypoint to `js/const.js`.
- [x] Delete `js/config.js` after migration.
- [x] Reintroduce `js/symbols.js` as the canonical late-bound owner of `display.h` glyph/symbol constants.
- [x] Normalize imports to `const.js` across runtime and tests.

### 1B. Documentation / tooling alignment
- [x] Remove active references to deleted/retired files (`config.js`, `objclass.js`) in docs, scripts, comments, templates.
- [x] Keep historical timestamped artifacts unchanged (`docs/metrics`, `docs/port-status`, `docs/archive`).

### 1C. Phase-1 remaining work
- [x] Confirm canonical ownership table in `docs/MODULES.md` and `docs/STRUCTURES.md` has no stale text.
  - No references to deleted files (`config.js`, `objclass.js`).
  - Updated "The rule" section to document expanded leaf header taxonomy.
- [x] Run full parity report and record a short Phase-1 signoff note in docs.
  - See Phase-1 exit gate below.

### 1D. Constant export rule enforcement (pulled into Phase 1)
- [x] Only leaf headers export capitalized constants.
  - Core leaf headers: `const.js`, `objects.js`, `monsters.js`, `version.js`.
  - Data-definition leaf headers: `artifacts.js`, `engrave_data.js`, `epitaph_data.js`, `rumor_data.js`.
  - Options leaf header: `storage.js` (`DEFAULT_FLAGS`, `OPTION_DEFS` — config data, 30+ consumers).
- [x] Move any stray exported capitalized constants from gameplay modules.
  - Moved `DUNGEON_ALIGN_BY_DNUM` from `dungeon.js` → `const.js`.
  - Removed unused exports: `LORE_TEXT_TEMPLATE` (player.js), `TERRAIN_SYMBOLS_*` (render.js), `TYP_NAMES` (replay_compare.js).
  - Converted `WIN_*` mutable globals (windows.js) to getter function.
- [x] Normalize capitalized constant imports so they come from leaf headers only.

### 1E. Constant organization and documentation
- [x] Organize consolidated constants into clear sections in leaf headers (by subsystem/source).
  - `const.js` already organized by C header provenance with section comments.
  - `DUNGEON_ALIGN_BY_DNUM` placed adjacent to dungeon constants with C ref comment.
- [x] Document constant ownership and allowed import sources in `docs/MODULES.md`.
  - Updated "The rule" with three tiers: core, data-definition, and options leaf headers.
  - Updated Phase 3 description to use "leaf headers" instead of "four header files".
- [x] Add a quick audit command snippet for future checks.
  - Added "Audit command" section to MODULES.md with grep command and expected output.
- [x] Ensure newly moved `const.js` constants include C provenance comments.
  - `DUNGEON_ALIGN_BY_DNUM` has `// C ref: dungeon.c init_dungeons()` comment.

Phase-1 exit gate:
- [x] Structural targets in place for migrated subsystems.
- [x] No parity regression vs baseline envelope (2630/2639, 25/34 gameplay — matches baseline).
- [x] `rg "export (const|let|var) [A-Z]" js` reports only leaf header files (core + data + options).
- [x] Run full parity report (`scripts/run-and-report.sh`) and record Phase-1 signoff.
  - Phase-1 signoff: 2026-03-06, commit 88837e8b. 25/34 gameplay passing (matches baseline).
  - All 9 failures are dochug/monmove divergences (agent:game #213). No UX-agent regressions.

## Phase 2: C Field Name Normalization

### 2A. Attack field normalization (complete)
- [x] Update `gen_monsters.py` and `gen_artifacts.py` to emit canonical C names (`aatyp`/`adtyp`/`damn`/`damd`).
- [x] Regenerate `monsters.js` and `artifacts.js`.
- [x] Remove all `canonicalizeAttackFields()` calls and imports from runtime files.
- [x] Convert all legacy attack field reads (`.type`→`.aatyp`, `.ad`→`.adtyp`, `.dice`→`.damn`, `.sides`→`.damd`) across ~15 source files.
- [x] Fix `sanitizeMonsterType` fallback in `monutil.js` (was using old `.type` field name).
- [x] Update 4 test files with canonical field names.
- [x] Delete `js/attack_fields.js`.
- [x] Remove stale `file_policy.json` entry.

### 2B. Permonst field normalization — unambiguous batch (complete)
- [x] `mr1`→`mresists`, `mr2`→`mconveys` (resistance/conveyance bitmasks, ~50 sites)
- [x] `flags1/2/3`→`mflags1/2/3` (monster flag bitmasks, ~220 sites across 28 files)
- [x] `sound`→`msound` (monster sound type, 29 sites across 9 files)
- [x] `weight`→`cwt` (corpse weight on permonst only, ~8 sites)
- [x] `nutrition`→`cnutrit` (corpse nutrition on permonst only, ~6 sites)
- [x] `size` now emitted as `msize` in generator (alias already existed, kept for compat)
- [x] Fix `sanitizeMonsterType` in `monutil.js` (flags1→mflags1 etc.)
- [x] Update test mocks (monster_accuracy, combat, monmove, monster_nearby, domove_attackmon)

### 2C. Permonst field normalization — overloaded fields (complete)
These fields share names with monster instance, player, or object properties.
Required per-usage context analysis (not safe for `replace_all`):
- [x] `speed`→`mmove` (shared with monster.speed; migrated permonst reads in 8 files)
- [x] `attacks`→`mattk` (shared with monster.attacks; migrated permonst reads in 14 files)
- [x] `color`→`mcolor` (shared with obj/display; migrated 3 permonst reads)
- [x] `align`→`maligntyp` (shared with player/dungeon; migrated 8 permonst reads)
- [x] Generator emits `mlet`/`mlevel`/`mmove`/`mattk`/`mcolor`/`maligntyp` as primary names
- [x] Bidirectional aliases added via `normalizeMonsterFields` for backward compat
- [x] Cleaned up dual-read fallback patterns in muse.js, dothrow.js, hack.js
- [x] Updated test mock in domove_attackmon_safe_stop.test.js
- [x] `symbol`→`mlet`: runtime permonst reads migrated (audit 2026-03-06)
- [x] `level`→`mlevel`: runtime permonst reads migrated (audit 2026-03-06)
- [x] `name`→`mname` (done by constgen agent; alias `name`↔`mname` added)

### 2D. Objclass field normalization (complete)
Generator now emits C-canonical names (oc_name, oc_descr, oc_color, oc_prob,
oc_delay, oc_wt, oc_cost, oc_wsdam, oc_wldam, oc_oc1, oc_oc2, oc_nutrition,
oc_material, oc_oprop, oc_dir, oc_subtyp) with getter/setter alias pairs for
backward compat. Aliases include C macro aliases: oc_skill↔oc_subtyp,
oc_bulky↔oc_bimanual↔big.

- [x] Generator emits all C-canonical objclass field names
- [x] Getter/setter aliases propagate writes between canonical and legacy names
- [x] Fixed ~35 live bugs (oc_material, oc_dir, oc_skill, oc_oprop, oc_name, etc. were undefined)
- [x] Fixed pager.js undefined `obj_descr` variable
- [x] Fixed do_name.js `oc_weight` (should be `oc_wt`)
- [x] Migrated `.material`→`.oc_material` (~45 reads, 20 files)
- [x] Migrated `.desc`→`.oc_descr` (~42 reads, 7 files)
- [x] Migrated `.name`→`.oc_name` (~115 reads, 12 files)
- [x] Migrate remaining legacy reads: .prob, .cost, .color, .weight, .delay, .sdam, .ldam, .oc1, .oc2, .sub, .dir, .prop, .nutrition
  - Audit (2026-03-06): no remaining runtime `objectData[...]` legacy field reads for these names outside generated `objects.js`; remaining matches are non-objclass contexts.
- [x] Normalize obj instance `.name`→`.oname` in gameplay object contexts
  - Remaining `.name` reads are monster/player/meta contexts (not object instance naming fields).

Phase-2 exit gate:
- [x] No remaining attack alias reads/writes.
- [x] `attack_fields.js` deleted with no remaining imports.
- [x] No remaining unambiguous permonst aliases (mr1/2, flags1/2/3, sound, weight, nutrition).
- [x] No parity regression vs baseline envelope (2511/2511 unit, 25/34 gameplay).
- [x] Objclass generator emits C-canonical names with getter/setter aliases.
- [x] Top 3 objclass fields migrated (oc_name, oc_descr, oc_material — ~200 reads total).
- [x] Remaining objclass legacy reads migration completed (runtime paths).

## Phase 3: File-Per-C-Source Reorganization

Move functions so each JS file aligns to its C source file. Cyclic imports
between gameplay files are explicitly allowed — function bindings resolve
lazily at call time, so moving functions cannot create init-time cycles.

- [x] Move functions from JS "consolidation" files (`combat.js`, `look.js`,
      `monutil.js`, `stackobj.js`, `discovery.js`, `options_menu.js`) into
      their canonical C-source-named JS files.
- [x] Keep remaining `player.js` scope intentional (Player struct/state runtime);
      roles/races tables moved to `role.js`.
- [x] Each move commit is structure-only (no logic edits mixed in).
- [x] Update `docs/MODULES.md` ownership table after each batch.

Phase-3 exit gate:
- [x] Ownership mapping in `docs/MODULES.md` reflects code reality.
- [x] No parity regression vs baseline envelope.

## Phase 4: Remove `set*Context` Wiring Hacks

The `set*Context` / `set*Player` pattern was introduced to pass runtime state
(player, display, map, FOV) into modules that couldn't import it due to feared
circular dependency issues. Now that we know cyclic imports are safe for
functions, these hacks can be replaced by direct imports or by passing state
as function parameters (matching how C passes struct pointers).

### Inventory of hacks to remove

| Module | Setter | Internal var | Callers |
|--------|--------|-------------|---------|
| pline.js | `setOutputContext()` | `_outputContext` | allmain, chargen, headless |
| mkobj.js | `setObjectMoves()` | `_objectMoves` | allmain, chargen |
| mkobj.js | `setMklevObjectContext()` | `_inMklevContext` | dungeon |
| mkobj.js | `setLevelDepth()` | `_levelDepth` | dungeon |
| timeout.js | `setTimerContext()` | `_timeoutContext` | timeout (internal) |

- [ ] For each setter: replace with direct import of `game` singleton or
      explicit parameter passing, matching C's approach.
- [ ] Remove setter functions and module-level context variables.
- [x] Keep bootstrap/UI-only runtime setup where appropriate.

Current Phase-4 reality snapshot (2026-03-06):
- Completed/reduced in prior passes: `setOutputContext`, timer/global state
  wiring, display context override wiring (`setDisplayContext`), and makemon
  setter wiring now replaced with scoped/direct-state helpers, and level-context
  wiring now scoped through `withLevelContext`; finalize-context wiring now
  scoped through `withFinalizeContext`.
- Remaining active setters (still to eliminate or formally justify): none.

Phase-4 exit gate:
- [ ] No `set*Context` / `set*Player` style module-level wiring remains.
- [ ] No parity regression vs baseline envelope.

## Validation Commands (Use Per Batch)

- `scripts/run-and-report.sh`
- `node --test test/unit/config.test.js`
- `node --test test/unit/symbol_accuracy.test.js`
- `node test/comparison/session_test_runner.js test/comparison/sessions/seed42_gameplay.session.json`

## Current Focus

- Phase 3 complete (consolidation files dissolved; ownership documented).
- Constants ownership routed to leaf modules:
  - `display.h` -> `symbols.js`
  - `permonst.h` -> `monsters.js`
  - `objclass.h` -> `objects.js`
  - `const.js` deferred report now at zero.
- Current execution target: Phase 4 cleanup of remaining setter/context wiring.
