# Porting Lore

Lessons learned during C-to-JS porting work. Record findings here when
fixing parity divergences, so future porting work benefits from past
discoveries.

## Format

Each entry should include:
- **What**: the divergence or bug
- **Why**: root cause in C vs JS behavior
- **Fix**: what was changed and why it works
